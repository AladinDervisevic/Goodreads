on stage with one of literature’s most famous opening lines. “I am an American, Chicago born, and go at things as I have taught myself, free-style, and will make the record in my own way: first to knock, first admitted.” It’s the “Call me Ishmael” of mid-20th-century American fiction. (For the record, Bellow was born in Canada.) Or it would be if Ishmael had been more like Tom Jones with a philosophical disposition. With this teeming book Bellow returned a Dickensian richness to the American novel. As he makes his way to a full brimming consciousness of himself, Augie careens himself through numberless occupations, and countless mentors and exemplars, all the while enchanting us with the slapdash American music of his voice.</span></div></div></div></div><div data-testid="genresList" class="BookPageMetadataSection__genres"><ul class="CollapsableList" aria-label="Top genres for this book"><span class="BookPageMetadataSection__genre"><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/genres/fiction" class="Button Button--tag-inline Button--medium"><span class="Button__labelItem">Fiction</span></a></span> <span class="BookPageMetadataSection__genre"><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/genres/classics" class="Button Button--tag-inline Button--medium"><span class="Button__labelItem">Classics</span></a></span> <span class="BookPageMetadataSection__genre"><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/genres/literature" class="Button Button--tag-inline Button--medium"><span class="Button__labelItem">Literature</span></a></span> <span class="BookPageMetadataSection__genre"><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/genres/novels" class="Button Button--tag-inline Button--medium"><span class="Button__labelItem">Novels</span></a></span> <div class="Button__container"><button type="button" class="Button Button--tag-inline Button--medium" aria-label="Show all items in the list"><span class="Button__labelItem">...more</span></button></div></ul></div><div class="BookDetails"><div class="CollapsableList"><span class="Text Text__body3"><div class="FeaturedDetails"><p data-testid="pagesFormat">586 pages, Paperback</p><p data-testid="publicationInfo">First published September 18, 1953</p><p data-testid="awards"><span class="CollapsableList"><span data-testid="award"><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/award/show/33-national-book-award">National Book Award</a>, Fiction<span class="Text Text__subdued"> (1954)</span></span></span></p></div></span> <div class="Button__container"><button type="button" class="Button Button--inline Button--small" aria-label="Show more book details"><span class="Button__labelItem">More details</span></button></div></div></div><hr class="Divider" role="presentation"/><div class="AuthorPreview"><div class="AuthorPreview__profile"><div class="AuthorPreview__avatar"><a class="Avatar Avatar--large" href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4391.Saul_Bellow" as="div"><img data-testid="image" class="Avatar__image" alt="Saul Bellow" src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/authors/1470607356i/4391._UX200_CR0,28,200,200_.jpg"/></a></div><div class="AuthorPreview__info"><h3 class="Text H3"><a class="ContributorLink" href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4391.Saul_Bellow"><span class="ContributorLink__name" data-testid="name">Saul Bellow</span></a></h3><div class="AuthorPreview__meta"><span class="Text Text__body3 Text__subdued">156<!-- --> <!-- -->books<span class="u-dot-before">1,574<!-- --> <!-- -->followers</span></span></div></div></div><div class="TruncatedText"><div class="TruncatedText__text TruncatedText__text--3" data-testid="contentContainer"><div><span class="Formatted">Saul Bellow was born in Lachine, Quebec, a suburb of Montreal, in 1915, and was raised in Chicago. He attended the University of Chicago, received his Bachelor's degree from Northwestern University in 1937, with honors in sociology and anthropology, did graduate work at the University of Wisconsin, and served in the Merchant Marines during World War II.<br /><br />Mr. Bellow's first novel, <i>Dangling Man</i>, was published in 1944, and his second, <i>The Victim</i>, in 1947. In 1948 he was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship and spent two years in Paris and traveling in Europe, where he began <i>The Adventures of Augie March,</i>, which won the National Book Award for fiction in 1954. Later books include <i>Seize The Day</i> (1956), <i>Henderson The Rain King</i> (1959), <i>Herzog</i> (1964), <i>Mosby's Memoirs and Other Stories</i> (1968), and <i>Mr. Sammler's Planet</i> (1970). <i>Humboldt's Gift</i> (1975), was awarded the Pulitzer Prize. Both Herzog and Mr. Sammler's Planet were awarded the National Book Award for fiction. Mr. Bellow's first non-fiction work, <i>To Jerusalem and Back: A Personal Account</i>, published on October 25,1976, is his personal and literary record of his sojourn in Israel during several months in 1975.<br /><br />In 1965 Mr. Bellow was awarded the International Literary Prize for Herzog, becoming the first American to receive the prize. In January 1968 the Republic of France awarded him the Croix de Chevalier des Arts et Lettres, the highest literary distinction awarded by that nation to non-citizens, and in March 1968 he received the B'nai B'rith Jewish Heritage Award for "excellence in Jewish literature". In November 1976 he was awarded the America's Democratic Legacy Award of the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, the first time this award was made to a literary personage.<br /><br />A playwright as well as a novelist, Mr. Bellow was the author of <i>The Last Analysis</i> and of three short plays, collectively entitled <i>Under the Weather</i>, which were produced on Broadway in 1966. He contributed fiction to <i>Partisan Review, Playboy, Harper's Bazaar, The New Yorker, Esquire</i>, and to literary quarterlies. His criticism appeared in <i>The New York Times Book Review</i>, <i>Horizon, Encounter, The New Republic, The New Leader</i>, and elsewhere. During the 1967 Arab-lsraeli conflict, he served as a war correspondent for <i>Newsday</i>. He taught at Bard College, Princeton University, and the University of Minnesota, and was a member of the Committee on Social Thought at the University of Chicago.</span></div></div></div></div><hr

wonder how picaresque a life of any individual may look from the outside. <br />A little man in a big world, all alone and lost in a crowd – how to find one’s walk of life and what way to choose?<br /><blockquote>Friends, human pals, men and brethren, there is no brief, digest, or shorthand way to say where it leads. Crusoe, alone with nature, under heaven, had a busy, complicated time of it with the unhuman itself, and I am in a crowd that yields results with much more difficulty and reluctance and am part of it myself.</blockquote><br />And wherever one is going one can’t be sure that a blind alley doesn’t lie ahead.<br /><blockquote>The spirit of man, enslaved, sobs in the silence of boredom, the bitter antagonist. Boredom therefore can arise from the cessation of habitual functions, even though these may be boring too. It is also the shriek of unused capacities, the doom of serving no great end or design, or contributing to no master force. The obedience that is not willingly given because nobody knows how to request it. The harmony that is not accomplished. This lies behind boredom.</blockquote><br />Fortune and misfortune, adventures and misadventures, conceptions and misconceptions, understanding and misunderstanding: that’s the stuff the human life is made of.</span></div></div></div></section></section><section class="ReviewCard__tags"><ul class="CollapsableList"></ul></section><footer class="SocialFooter"><div data-testid="stats"

city--and go at things as I have taught myself, free-style, and will make the record in my own way: first to knock, first admitted; sometimes an innocent knock, sometimes a not so innocent. But a man’s character is his fate, says Heraclitus, and in the end there isn’t any way to disguise the nature of the knocks by acoustical work on the door or gloving the knuckles.”</b><br /><br />When I worked in a bookstore in Phoenix, there was this judge who frequently came in, usually late at night to buy stacks of books. He was a voracious reader. He had been in the OSS in WW2 and was one of the officers involved in the arrest of Hermann Göring. As he said, “I actually laid hands on the man.” Needless to say, the judge was one of the smartest and most interesting guys I’ve ever met. One slow night, I hadn’t seen a customer in over an hour. I was lounging at the register, reading Saul Bellow, and the judge came in. He was so tickled I was reading Augie March, the best book he’d ever read about growing up in the depression. The Odyssey of the modern era. What baffled me the most was when this ultra successful guy says to me...I wish I’d had March’s life. <br /><br />Success lays its own traps for us. We find ourselves frog marched along until the next thing we know the whole world would think we were insane to want to be anything other than what we have become. <br /><br />I found the going tough in March, and even though this guy I admired so much had endorsed it so vigorously, at some point, I set the book aside, not to return to it for 33 years. <br /><br />Judge, wherever you are now...I finished <i>The Adventures of Augie March</i>! The weight of this reading indiscretion has been lifted from my shoulders. <br /><br />I don’t know that Bellow set out to write a masterpiece as he started stacking the pages of this novel. He might have just been having a lot of fun. The whacky, freewheeling style of the novel has me comparing certain aspects of it to <i>Catch-22</i>. The comedic elements, subtle but constant, keeps even the most tragic of circumstances that Augie finds himself ensnared from becoming too heavy. <br /><br />Throughout the novel Augie is encouraged to go to University and does frequently consider it, usually when events have conspired against him. Going to school is frankly just too rigid a system for him. It is why he can’t hold down a regular job and why he is attracted to skilless jobs as long as he has more freedom of movement. He starts working for a man he would admire for the rest of his life, named Einhorn, while still in high school. <i>”’What would Caesar suffer in this case? What would Machiavelli advise or Ulysses do? What would Einhorn think? I’m not kidding when I enter Einhorn in this eminent list.”</i> Einhorn is far from being on the up and up. He is a cripple who manages his affairs from a wheelchair but seems to be able to see the workings of the world very clearly, even if he isn’t able to see it for himself. <br /><br />Another example of a nontraditional job that Augie holds for a while is stealing books. He is supposed to sell them on to the customers who requested them, but he refuses to give the books up until he has read them. He suffers from a spat of bibliophilia that is nearly impossible to shake off. His partner in crime even offers him his library card. He wants him to check the books out of the library instead. <b>”But somehow that wasn’t the same. As eating your own meal.”</b> Ahh yes, there is a difference. There is, in my experience, always a stronger bond established between a reader and a book they own. <br /><br />Augie falls in love/lust over and over again. His first big love/lust was Esther Fenchel. <i>”I say, without a push of love and worship in my bowels at the curve of her hips, and triumphant maiden shape behind, and soft, protected secret. Where, to be allowed with love, would be the endorsement of the world, that it was not the barren confusion distant dry fears hinted and whispered, but was necessary, justified, the justification proved by joy. That if she would have, approve, kiss, use her hands on me, allow me the clay dust of the court from her legs, the mild sweat, her intimate dirt and sweat, deliver me from suffering falsehood--show that there wasn’t anything false, injurious, or empty-hearted that couldn’t be corrected!”</i><br /><br />Does anyone else have the urge to fix those sentences?<br /><br />Of course, he is basing all this rather courtly devotion to her on her most shallow attributes. Her sister Thea circles around the love sick Augie unnoticed in the glow emanating from her sister. She realizes his desires for her sister are hopeless, and she feels she is the better match for Augie. In a book full of crazy decisions, probably one of the most insane that Augie gets himself involved in is a wild trip to Mexico, featuring Thea and Caligula the eagle. It is a cocked up mess from beginning to end. <br /><br /><b>“‘You’ve lost a tooth.’ I nodded. I knew where the gap was. But sooner or later you’re bound to lose some teeth.”</b><br /><br />Augie has a chance to be rich more than once, but if there is one thing that he can be counted on to do….it is to make the wrong decision. A rich couple even offers to adopt him as their son. This would have made him a rich man for life. He refuses, unwilling to be a family pet, even if it does mean a lifetime of financial security. Honorable? Well yes, you could make that case, but given the staccato bizarreness of his life, it might have been a very prudent offer to accept. <br /><br />During the war, the army doesn’t want him. He joins the Merchant Marine to do his bit. Of course, he doesn’t know that the Merchant Marine suffers the highest casualty rates of the war, and sure enough his ship is bombed by a torpedo. Augie finds himself in a raft with an insane genius who doesn’t want to be saved but only wants to find an island to continue his research. Only Augie, out of the hundreds of men on the ship, could end up in a boat with the most barmy of the lot. <br /><br />The book ends with Augie living in France with Stella. She is trying to make a go of being an actress, and Augie is involved in some shady dealings. I can sense that Augie is looking towards the horizon, dreaming about the experiences and adventures that await him just over the curve of the earth. <br /><br />Wikipedia has a great summary of this book. <i>”With an intricate plot and allusive style, Bellow explores contrasting themes of alienation and belonging, poverty and wealth, love and loss, with often comic undertones.”</i> Because Augie is so free spirited, impossible to chain down in any profession or relationship, Bellow has an opportunity, through this character, to evaluate every nugget of human experience. Saul Bellow was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1976, and this book was mentioned as his greatest contribution to literature. Masterpiece? Of course, it is. The Judge couldn’t possibly be wrong. <br /><br /><i>
  <b>”In yourself you labor, you wage and combat, settle scores, remember insults, fight, reply, deny, blab, denounce, triumph, outwit, overcome, vindicate, cry, persist, absolve, die and rise again. All by yourself! Where is everybody? Inside your breast and skin, the entire cast.”</b>

class="Formatted"><b>Original Review:</b><br><br><b>In Pursuit of Exuberance</b><br><br>I first read this in the mid-to-late 70's.<br><br>For a long time, I would have rated Bellow as one of my favourite three to five authors and Augie as one of my top three novels.<br><br>I haven't re-read it, but intend to. I am working from long distant memories now, but what I loved about it was the sense of exuberance and dynamism. At that time, it meant a lot to me to find evidence that intellect and vitality could be combined in one person.<br><br>It doesn't concern me so much now that I have found a level of comfort with my inner dork.<br><br><br><b>2013 Re-Read:</b><br><br><br><b>Busy Thinking Doing Being</b><br><br>This is a novel by and about a thinking man.<br><br>In saying this, I’m conscious of the inadequacy of the English language (or my command of it) to make my statement gender neutral.<br><br>I don’t want to say "thinking person" or "thinking human" or "thinking human being". These phrases are too ponderous and artificial.<br><br>I am willing, however, to call Augie March a "thinking being", because I want to go one step further and say he is a "thinking doing being".<br><br>And then to say, paraphrasing Bob Dylan, that he not busy thinking doing being is busy dying.<br><br>What I love about this novel is just how much Augie March gets up to during his [incomplete] life, how much thinking and learning, how much living and loving he does, while simultaneously defying his mortality and death.<br><br>For me, he is the epitome of a special brand of intellectual and personal dynamism. And this is one of my favourite novels.<br><br><b>A Quest with a Request</b><br><br>This review is an invitation to read a Great American Novel, but with a few caveats about length and style for some readers.<br><br>The novel is 536 pages long. It consists of 26 complete, well-defined chapters, but it doesn’t follow any preconceived linear plot. It contains a hero, in fact, many heroes, but it doesn’t consist of a traditional three act hero’s journey.<br><br>It’s not precisely crafted in the sense that what we read, the life experiences, have been heavily edited, abridged, distilled and selected, so that much life has been left out and what remains is the bare minimum the author could say.<br><br>Instead, much, much life has been left in, and what’s been said about that life is precisely crafted. It’s what Bellow needed and wanted to say about everything around him.<br><br>Bellow didn’t invite us into a cinema, sit us in a seat, turn out the lights and exclude the outside world, so that we could focus on his art.<br><br>Instead, he removed the ceiling, the walls and all of the obstacles that might block our sight, so that we could see and experience the real world, real people and real life. The book teems with reality, with realism, so much so that Bellow’s brother, Maurice, refused to speak to him for five years after its publication.<br><br>This novel, this filmic experience, this thought process might be longer than what is conventional. If that bothers you, this might not be the book for you. But if it doesn’t, then, like me, you might find it one of the most rewarding reading experiences of your life.<br><br><b>A Smorgasbord, Not for the Smorgasbored</b><br><br>“Augie March” is a smorgasbord, not a TV dinner. It’s not pre-packaged and pre-digested. It invites you to focus and observe and think and enjoy.<br><br>It’s expansive, sprawling, discursive, in the sense of "fluent and expansive rather than formulaic or abbreviated". <br><br>Sometimes, it seems to be a directionless wander, other times a wild ride. Augie is a wonder boy with a wanderlust. But at all times, Augie’s quest is singular, like Christopher Columbus, to discover America, the world, and through it, himself. <br><br>You might not enjoy this novel, unless you can relate to his quest, his adventures and his discoveries, unless you can imagine yourself on board the "Pinta", the "Nina" or the "Santa Maria", setting sail for some unknown, far horizon. <br><br>I urge you not to embark, if you are easily bored or fear you might want to jump ship mid-voyage or mid-adventure. The novel is ship-shape. It would take only you to torpedo it. It would break my heart to read yet another uncomprehending three star (or less) review of this brilliant and important novel. But if you’re not deterred, welcome aboard!<br><br><b>A Picaresque Without a Picaro</b><br><br>Now that it’s just you and me, let’s talk about Augie, baby, and his adventures.<br><br>Many critics describe "Augie March" as a picaresque novel.<br><br>The Spanish word "picaro" means a rogue or a rascal. The Wiki definition mentions that a picaresque narrative is usually a first person autobiographical account; the main character is often of low character or social class; and there is little if any character development in the main character, whose circumstances may change but rarely result in a change of heart.<br><br>The reference in the title to "adventures" hints at this narrative tradition, as does Augie’s lower class orphan social status.<br><br>However, Augie isn’t just content to let things happen to him. He’s not passive. He goes where his quest takes him. He is not there by accident or fate. What happens there might not have happened if he had remained at home. His experiences and adventures are a direct response to his quest.<br><br><b>Achievement Without Lineage</b><br><br>Just as there is little or no narrative linearity in the novel, Augie has no familial lineage of any grandeur.<br><br>Bellow strips him of his father. Augie is "the by-blow of a travelling man" (a child born out of wedlock). He has no recollection of his father.<br><br>Nevertheless, Augie’s mother is responsible for three boys and a dog, and family love is at the heart of the novel:<br><br><i>"Georgie Mahchy, Augie, Simey<br>Winnie Mahchy, evwy, evwy love Mama."</i><br><br>Mama is not a strong-willed, domineering matriarchal type in the Jewish tradition. The mantle of that role is assumed by Grandma Lausch, not a blood relative, but a Russian (Odessa) lodger, "boss-woman, governing hand, queen mother, empress" and major influence who wants what is best in life for Augie and his brothers. She sees potential for greatness in the boys and wants them to aspire and succeed to greatness.<br><br>To this extent, the novel is about the achievement of aspirations, both internal and external.<br><br>Augie’s quest is for material independence and love. If he achieves these two things, he will have learned the meaning of his life.<br><br>Having achieved himself, he will leave a heritage, a legacy for his own family. He will have commenced an empire, a lineage of his own.<br><br><b>Nobility Without Savagery</b><br><br>The single word that captures both of Augie’s aspirations is "nobility".<br><br>A key metaphor in the novel is the difference between nobility and savagery.<br><br>We are all part of the Animal Kingdom, but what separates humanity (human beings) from the other animals is the capacity for thought, the ability to be dignified, sophisticated, social, cultured, marvellous, refined, sublime and civilized, the tendency to explore, discover, invent, create, learn and teach.<br><br>This is our nobility, what separates us not just from animal savagery, but human savagery (such as was to be experienced in the Holocaust).<br><br>While I understand Augie’s name is pronounced "Or-gie", I can’t get out of the habit of pronouncing "Augie" as "Ow-gie" in the German fashion (like I suspect Grandma Lausch did).<br><br>Augie’s name is presumably short for August, which hints of the noble in its own right, for example, the name Augustus (Caesar), but more likely in the adjective "august" ("inspiring reverence or admiration; of supreme dignity or grandeur; majestic") and its Latin etymology (augustus: "venerable, majestic, magnificent, noble," probably originally "consecrated by the augurs, with favorable auguries").<br><br>With all of these personal aspirations and social expectations, it’s crucial that Augie succeed, that he triumph in life.<br><br>The outcome he fears most is failure. He can’t bear the thought of being a "flop".<br><br>In this way, his adventure with first real love, Thea, in Mexico with an eagle that hunts iguanas and snakes is symbolic of Augie’s own plight.<br><br>The eagle is called Caligula, after the Roman Emperor, but equally importantly, the Spanish word for eagle is "águila", which doesn’t take much contortion to become Augie.<br><br>This eagle should be the most noble and august of birds, yet it fails to achieve its purpose. In the eyes of the township, it becomes the flop that Augie feared.<br><br><b>A Man’s Character is His Fate</b><br><br>Augie’s great advantage is that he is a good listener, "clever junge", bright, intelligent, hopeful, optimistic, eager, [mostly] honest, "ehrlich", loyal, strong, tough, robust, sensual, handsome and grows to be 5' 11" (four inches taller than Bellow himself, thus achieving one of the author’s personal aspirations). <br><br>He also feels both obliged (or obligated) in the pursuit of his own self-improvement, and obliging in the support of others.<br><br>If anything, his greatest risk is that others can easily take advantage of him, his friendship and his generosity.<br><br>This is not to say he is an easy con. It is his nature, his character, and in the words of Heraclitus, "a man’s character is his fate."<br><br><b>A Woman’s Influence on a Man’s Fate</b><br><br>While Augie’s adventures are necessarily masculine, women play a vital role at every step as mother (Mama, Grandma Lausch, Mrs Renling), lover (Lucy, Sophie, Thea, Stella) and friend (Mimi).<br><br>Mrs Renling is almost as ambitious for Augie as Grandma Lausch: <br><br><i>"An educated man with a business is a lord."</i><br><br>Cousin Anna Coblin shares the view that Augie deserves to succeed: <br><br><i>"You should know only happiness, as you deserve."</i><br><br><b>Working Class Politics</b><br> <br>One of Augie’s mentors, Mr Einhorn points out that he is a contrarian:<br><br><i>"This was the first time that anyone had told me anything like the truth about myself. I felt it powerfully. That, as he said, I did have opposition in me, and great desire to offer resistance and to say 'No!' which was as clear as could be, as definite a feeling as a pang of hunger."</i><br><br>Augie spends some of his apprenticeship in life as a union organiser. He is good at it and popular, except with rival unions.<br><br>Like Bellow himself, Augie reads up on Marx and becomes an anti-Stalinist Trotskyist for a while. He even sees Trotsky in Mexico from a distance, just days before his assassination. (Bellow himself missed meeting Trotsky by days.)<br><br>However, Augie’s heart is not behind the cause at this grass roots level, especially when he has unresolved issues with Thea to deal with.<br><br><b>The Universal Eligibility to Be Noble</b><br><br>I was always disappointed that, in his later novels, Bellow became less left-wing and more conservative and curmudgeonly.<br><br>To a certain extent, he moved with the times, in response to revelations about the reality of Soviet Communism and the invasions of Hungary and Czechoslovakia.<br><br>I don’t think he ever became a fully-fledged Neo-Conservative, more what we called an Anti-Anti-Communist, someone who was sympathetic to the Left, but was not a supporter of McCarthyite tactics.<br><br>He was a writer, not an activist. Like Augie, to quote James Atlas, he was more interested in experiencing "life’s intellectual, aesthetic and sensual pleasures".<br><br>However, more specifically, in terms of Augie’s worldview, what both author and character seemed to believe in was "the universal eligibility to be noble".<br><br>They were not so much concerned with the primacy of Equality, whether of outcome or income, but the equal opportunity to achieve Nobility in all the senses that make a human civilized and a civilization great.<br><br><b>"I am an American, Chicago Born"</b><br><br>This might all sound very obvious and trite to you, but I first read "Augie March", when I was defining my own political and cultural views, and Bellow’s and Augie’s example was absolutely vital to me, especially because, part of my own intellectual development occurred in an anti-intellectual context, where it was reassuring to know that intelligence and personal dynamism could be combined successfully in one person.<br><br>The other reason I am so protective and assertive of the merits of this novel is what it represented in the America of 1953.<br><br>Bellow was a Jew, a member of a race that had been denied entry into society, members clubs, golf clubs, academia and the cultural intelligentsia.<br><br>Bellow’s third, most ambitious novel burst onto the American literary scene with the following memorable words:<br><br><i>"I am an American, Chicago born…and go at things as I have taught myself, free-style, and will make the record in my own way: first to knock, first admitted."</i><br><br>Augie was asserting his own Americanness, opposed to any attempt to marginalize him because of his racial or religious background.<br><br>He was an American, first, a Jew, an American Jew. There was no inconsistency between the two qualities. He was proud to be both. He was proud to be the one.<br><br>When I recently read and reviewed "The Great Gatsby", I wrote about a Capitalist America, that survived and arguably thrived in some way by maintaining an exclusivity.<br><br>Perhaps, Gatsby’s only failure, the reason he could grasp the American Dream as a Holy Grail and find that it disintegrated in his hands, was that he didn’t realise that he wasn’t welcome by those who were already at the top.<br><br>In a way, Jay Gatsby handed the baton onto Augie March, who then insisted on making his way through those doors wedged closed, so that more people could follow him and have their contribution to America recognised and respected.<br><br>Whereas "The Great Gatsby" describes exclusion, "Augie March" conveys a message of inclusion, not necessarily assimilation, but co-existence in harmony of purpose and outcome.<br><br>So "Augie March" was a major assertion and achievement for an American Jew, an even greater achievement when the novel won the National Book Award for the most distinguished American novel of 1953.<br><br>I am still more sentimental about this book than "Herzog" or "Humboldt’s Gift", and therefore I am motivated to say that "Augie March" was a large part of the argument for Bellow’s entitlement to receive the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1976.<br><br>I am not an American, I am not Chicago born, I am not a Jew. However, the thing about "Augie March", this book written by a 38 year old American Jew, almost 20 years younger than I am now, is that it resounded with me all this way across the world, once upon a time 20 years after it was written, then again 60 years after it was written, and during every moment in between and for every moment during which my heart might beat and my mind might imagine afterwards.<br><br><b>Free-Style, In My Own Way</b><br><br>It wasn’t just the subject matter that appealed to me, though that would have been enough. It was the language.<br><br>Bellow’s first sentence announced his modus operandi: he wasn’t going to be constrained by convention, he was going to write free-style, in his own way, autodidactically, because he wanted to communicate what he had learned himself, rather than being taught.<br><br>As it turned out, he wrote like he spoke. It didn’t read like it was written, it sounded like it was said and we were listening to it. Augie could speak as if in the street, as if in a bar, as if in a club. It was entertaining, persuasive, informative, endearing, inspiring. Even when most intellectual, his words were still beautiful to listen to.<br><br>This was no smug Ivy League belletrist pronouncing from the comfort and security of his study. As Bellow has revealed, not a word of this novel was written in Chicago. This was a man jotting down the intricate workings of his mind while sailing across the Atlantic or sitting drinking coffee in a Parisian or Mediterranean cafe.<br><br>Like Joyce’s portrait of Dublin, this was Chicago and New York remembered from afar, painted from memory, complete with its own deli sights and smells and Yiddish rhythms and intonation.<br><br>Bellow never descended into purple prose. Everything seemed to be in exactly the right place, as required to communicate effectively. Yet frequently, I wondered at the beauty of his prose, speculating on whether anybody had ever used this combination of simple words in this precise way before.<br><br>I'll leave you with a random sampling of sentences that appealed:<br><br><i>"I have always tried to become what I am."</i><br><br><i>"I have a feeling with respect to the axial lines of life, with respect to which you must be straight or else your existence is merely clownery, hiding tragedy."</i><br> <br><i>"Happy as a god."</i><br><br><i>"You are the author of your own death. What is the weapon? The nails and hammer of your character. What is the cross? Your own bones on which you gradually weaken."</i><br><br><i>"Mama was beginning to have the aging stiffness and was somewhat bowlegged; she enjoyed the cold air though, and still had her calm smooth color of health.”</i><br><br><i>”She could be singular too, when she’d swagger or boast or vie against other women; or fish compliments, or force me to admire her hair or skin, which I didn’t have to be forced to do."</i><br><br><i>"I felt her conduct like a kind of touching athletic prowess."</i><br> <br><i>"There was the object of these wicked thoughts with a warm healthy face, looking innocent and happy to see me. What a beauty! My heart whanged without a pity for me. I already saw myself humbled in the dust of love, the god Eros holding me down with his foot and forcing all kinds of impossible stuff on me."</i><br><br><i>"We were risen up high with pleasure. We had all the luck in love we could ask, and it was maybe improved by the foreignness we found in each other."</i><br><br><img src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1380346065i/700552._SY540_.png" width="400" height="500" alt="description" class="gr-hostedUserImg" loading="lazy"> <br><br><b>Nobility Rewarded with a Nobel Prize</b><br><br>Here is an extract from Bellow's Nobel Prize Acceptance Speech.<br><br>It gives some insight into the Nobility of the thinking doing being and its origin in the quest to know ourselves and others, in other words, in Augie's quest:<br><br><i>"When complications increase, the desire for essentials increases too. The unending cycle of crises that began with the First World War has formed a kind of person, one who has lived through terrible, strange things, and in whom there is an observable shrinkage of prejudices, a casting off of disappointing ideologies, an ability to live with many kinds of madness, an immense desire for certain durable human goods - truth, for instance, or freedom, or wisdom. <br><br>"I don't think I am exaggerating; there is plenty of evidence for this. Disintegration? Well, yes. Much is disintegrating but we are experiencing also an odd kind of refining process. And this has been going on for a long time. <br><br>"Looking into Proust's Time Regained I find that he was clearly aware of it. His novel, describing French society during the Great War, tests the strength of his art. Without art, he insists, shirking no personal or collective horrors, we do not know ourselves or anyone else. <br><br>"Only art penetrates what pride, passion, intelligence and habit erect on all sides - the seeming realities of this world. <br><br>"There is another reality, the genuine one, which we lose sight of. <br><br>"This other reality is always sending us hints, which, without art, we can't receive. <br><br>"Proust calls these hints our ‘true impressions.’ The true impressions, our persistent intuitions, will, without art, be hidden from us and we will be left with nothing but a ‘terminology for practical ends which we falsely call life.’ <br><br>"Tolstoy put the matter in much the same way. A book like his Ivan Ilyitch also describes these same ‘practical ends’ which conceal both life and death from us. In his final sufferings Ivan Ilyitch becomes an individual, a "character", by tearing down the concealments, by seeing through the ‘practical ends.’"</i><br>

class="ReviewText"><section class="ReviewText__content"><div class="TruncatedText"><div class="TruncatedText__text TruncatedText__text--5" data-testid="contentContainer"><div><span class="Formatted">Who am I to deny recognition of what others call “the Great American Novel”? Augie is launched on the world like a modern day Huckleberry Finn crossed with Tom Jones. But Augie’s arc does not quite have their level of comic edge, the moral quandaries of Huck or pursuit of women like Tom. Scrambling like a chameleon from one odd job or scheme to another he passes from one mentor to another, then breaks free but never quite grows up. He was a great inspiration for me, always aspiring to better himself and try something new and able to keep in flight without crashing after hard knocks.<br /><br />He starts from humble beginnings of poverty in the depression-era Chicago melting pot, with an absent father and a neglectful mother he describes as “simple minded”. His guidance by a controlling Russian immigrant boarder, Anna Lausch, assumes the proportions of that of a typical mother and a label as “Grandma”. As we see in Wells’ “The Glass Castle”, the major life skill she imparts is the ability to manipulate others and, of equal importance, to see through the ploys of others. When he is nine, she engages him with a role in a caper to assure the optometrist will give his mother free glasses. He older brother Simon was not up to the lying required as he saw the world in the black and white of a Boy Scout. Augie is a natural at such dissembling:<br /><br /><i>I could be counted on to do the job, because I enjoyed it. I loved a piece of strategy. I had enthusiasms too; I had Simon’s …, and I had Grandma Lausch’s as well.</i> <br /><br />The “enthusiasms” referred to in Augie’s reflections (from late in life as our narrator) point the moral grounding he got from his brother’s noble aspirations. His love and empathy for his younger brother, Georgie, who is cognitively handicapped, contributes to another humanizing influence on Augie’s character. His ersatz grandmother is stunning in Bellow’s marvelous portrayal, the epitome of a larger-than-life character:<br /><br /><i>She was as wrinkled as an old paper bag, an autocrat, hard-shelled and Jesuitical, a punchy old hawk of a Bolshevik, her small ribboned gray feet immobile on the shoekit and stool Simon had made in the manual-training class, dingy old wool Winnie whose bad smell filled the flat on the cushion beside her. If wit and discontent don’t necessarily go together, it wasn’t from the old woman that I learned it. She was impossible to satisfy.</i><br /><br />In retrospect Augie is able to see she was “one of those Machiavellis of small street and neighborhood that my young years were full of”, but at the time he took to heart many of her lessons, including a solid work ethic and a wariness over pursuit of love:<br /><br /><i>”You don’t know what’s coming if you think you can get by with laughing and eating peach pie.”<br />…<br />“Nobody asks you to love the whole world, only to be honest, <u>ehrlich</u>. Don’t have a loud mouth. The more you love people the more they’ll mix you up. A child loves, a person respects. Respect is better than love.</i><br /><br />By age 14 the critical lesson he is learning has to do with shaping one’s fate through applying oneself in work. Here he bounces back after being squelched in exploring music:<br /><br /><i>And when Anna snatched Howard’s saxophone, my thought was, “Go on. Take it. What do I want it for! I’ll do better than that. “ My mind was already dwelling on a good enough fate.<br />While the old lady, following her own idea of what that fate would be, continued to find various jobs for me.<br />Saying “various jobs,” I gave out the Rosetta stone, so to speak, to my entire life.</i><br /><br />From menial jobs like busboy or bellhop or dog training, Augie moves on to dabbling with robbery and graduates to an assistant and virtual son to a wealthy and powerful businessmen and later to an aristocrat with a love of expensive horses. This subsuming himself to others gets him in trouble, and he learns to invest himself in his own initiatives. But it takes him longer to get his balance when it comes to success over subjugations of love. At one extreme, he finds himself helping his strange girlfriend using an eagle to hunt iguanas in a Mexican desert. And in helping another woman escape an abusive relationship he jeopardizes his tenuous standing with the one he aspires to. <br /><br />I love how even though Augie dropped out of school, he is always reading and is always trying to forge lessons out of life. I find him to have the same kind of warm-hearted, questing outlook as Richard Ford’s Frank Bascom. <br /><br /><i>As long as I could keep improving my mind, I figured, I was doing okay.</i><br />Augie embodies the American dream of the potential to grab opportunities and become a self-made man. Though he never achieves a stable success or even clear goals for himself, his ability to keep morphing in the face of changing circumstances makes him a new kind of American hero. He has a lot of chutzpah blended with an admirable humility:<br /><br /><i>Everyone tries to create a world he can live in, and what he can't use he often can't see. But the real world is already created, and if your fabrication doesn't correspond, then even if you feel noble and insist on there being something better than what people call reality, that better something needn't try to exceed what, in its actuality, since we know it so little, may be very surprising. If a happy state of things, surprising; if miserable or tragic, no worse than what we invent.</i><br /><br />The literary experts pin Augie’s adventures down as “picaresque”, which Wiki charts from a Spanish tradition (think Cervantes) as tales of a “roguish hero of low social class who lives by his wits in a corrupt society.” There is some element of truth to the generalization on the form:<br /><br /><i> There is little if any character development in the main character. Once a picaro, always a picaro. His or her circumstances may change but they rarely result in a change of heart.</i><br /><br />But I believe Augie’s character gained in wisdom and independence over time. And I don’t see the satire or the comic, delusional hopelessness in his arc as we see with “Don Quixote”. He is closer to Jim Harrison’s “Brown Dog”, a rascal with heart, more a giver than a taker. I like to think that Augie learned to play like Brown Dog, found true love, and came to savor the rewards of “laughing and eating peach pie.”</span></div></div></div></section></section><section

class="ReviewText"><section class="ReviewText__content"><div class="TruncatedText"><div class="TruncatedText__text TruncatedText__text--5" data-testid="contentContainer"><div><span class="Formatted">Saul Bellow's <i>the Adventures of Augie March</i> is one of three things; it's either Saul Bellow's most verbose novel, a piece of fiction that almost stands as an historical document of Chicago during the Great Depression, or one of the best contemporary examples of the picaresque novel. Either way it's good and bad, and lovely and sprawling, and a testament to Bellow's fascination with the life that emanated from Chicago in the fifties.<br /><br />Augie, the protagonist of the story, is a tramp to say the least; the archetypal schlemil, drifting his way through life, partially making an attempt to please his family, yet at the same time basically trying to enjoy himself. Bellow's portrayal of this character is at times painful to read, and at the same time ridiculously sympathetic. There should be an emphasis on the term "character" here because Augie exemplifies what seems lost and maybe completely absent from the sort of post-war fiction that would follow novels such as <i>Augie March</i>, as well as that transitional novel of timeless greatness that is <i>the Recognitions</i>. He's a man who (tactfully juxtaposed by Bellow with his seemingly more level-headed brother Simon) can't seem to succeed, or rather simply doesn't want to. It's not that Augie is necessarily precocious or so determinately street clever, but it's because Augie's concept of the American dream is so freewheeling, and such an experimental riff on what it supposedly should be, that he can't seem to commit himself to one thing. <br /><br />Throughout the story we follow Augie as he at first earnestly, and eventually in a listless manner, pursues a series of jobs that never seem to offer enough of a sense of fulfillment. He's often shamed by his grandmother, clearly usurping the role of his feeble mother, to the point where his connection with his family eventually becomes a restraint; one that holds him back from doing whatever it is that he seems to want to do in life. This existential paradox, contained within the historical context of depression-era Chicago, is what essentially breathes life into this picaresque tale of self-discovery and struggle. However, the reader has to eventually wonder where these questions are to take them in understanding Bellow's commentary on the aimless nature of Augie's time and place.<br /><br /><i>Augie March</i> is undoubtedly Bellow's longest and most stylistically liberal piece of fiction. A superficial page count alone, outweighs the rest of his novels. And its style is more beat-language oriented than anything else that he's ever written. One can't help but be struck by the excessive lengthiness of his prose here, not to mention the clearly subjective tone and ostensibly autobiographical essence of the story. It hurts this wonderful book in a serious way. Finding Augie endearing is almost inescapable or obvious, but finding the narrative that Bellow feels the need to draw out to an almost irrelevant degree is much less appealing. This is because, in so many ways, Bellow ends up sounding redundant in narrating examples in which Augie fails and succeeds. For a novel so full of adventurous vignettes, some of them seem less important than others. And toward the end, the reader can't help but clearly ascertain the heavy-handed emphasis of Augie's inability to adapt to the real world; most certainly a Quixotic type character, and it's unlikely that Bellow, writing what can only be construed as a novel in the picaresque fashion, had Cervantes in mind when molding Augie March. But length has never proved to be a detriment to an intentional narrative. Bellow's intentions are successful, and are conveyed in the most beautiful ways at times, but overall the story is basically indulgent, taking its time with passages of storytelling that basically overstay their welcome.<br /><br />And yet, and yet, this is still someone who we appreciate because he is destined to fail. And failure is possibly even an inappropriate assessment of Augie. Maybe it's the sort of blind romanticism than was unavoidable for a character of Augie's individuality and charisma to have, more importantly, maybe it's just his nature to choose a path that, while exhilarating and just so full of life, inevitably leads him down roads that simply do no promise much of a future that looks ahead further than tomorrow or the next day. Whatever it is about this man, and even if Bellow goes to painful lengths to explain who Augie is, there's something about him that is such an exemplary version of the American spirit, to our shared concept of individual freedom, that we'd all be sore losers to say that it's unfeasible for any of us to see some static expression of hope and possibility in Augie March that we don't see in ourselves.</span></div></div></div></section></section><section class="ReviewCard__tags"><ul class="CollapsableList"><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/1107219?shelf=fiction" class="Button

From its opening lines, it takes along the heady projectory of Augie March in Chicago and elsewhere - not quite a Horatio Alger but perhaps a less burlesque Ignatius J Reilly whose author must have had Bellow's book in mind when he wrote a Confederacy of Dunces. Augie is a fantastic Everyman who draws us in to his attempts at finding himself. I found particularly that the first climax in Mexico was very moving. The voice that Bellow found here is rich in both Chicago street vernacular but with erudite references that reveal a more philosophical, deeper voyage despite the hijinks and hilarious adventures of the protagonist. I really loved this book perhaps even more than Seize the Day or Herzog.

class="ReviewText"><section class="ReviewText__content"><div class="TruncatedText"><div class="TruncatedText__text TruncatedText__text--5" data-testid="contentContainer"><div><span class="Formatted">I am an American, Altoona born--not Chicago, but just as somber. At an impressionable age I waited until class was over, then walked up, Bellow's <a href="https://goodreads.com/book/show/52782.Seize_the_Day" title="Seize the Day by Saul Bellow" rel="noopener"> Seize the Day</a> in hand, and asked Professor Mitchell for a moment of his time; Mr. Mitchell, with his wispy hair and pale skin, always the same blue suit, a librarian of a man, conceived before acid-free paper. I said, "The names, the names in this novel; every one is the name of a theorist in psychology. Surely that means something!" And Mr. Mitchell paused, so slightly, and then he made his lips purse--he MonaLisaed me, the bastard--and he said, "No. No-(almost a giggle)-No, I don't think so." And then he said, "Have you read <i>Augie March</i>?" "No, not yet." "You should really read <i>Augie March</i>!" And he actually looked happy, not triumphant, but like someone recalling a first, passionate love.<br /><br />And so, I did what any certifiable American would do: I refused to read <a href="https://goodreads.com/book/show/11908.The_Adventures_of_Augie_March" title="The Adventures of Augie March by Saul Bellow" rel="noopener"> The Adventures of Augie March</a> for 44 years. I'd show him! But this year, in the land of discord, I figured Mr. Mitchell has suffered enough. <br /><br />Mitchell was not alone in his look of post-coital pleasure in thinking on <i>Augie</i>. Christopher Hitchens enthused in the Introduction to the edition I read. And--my copy was purchased "used"--a former owner was kind enough to have left the pages of Martin Amis' famous essay inside, the essay in which Amis, a Brit, awards this book by Bellow, a Canadian, as "The Great American Novel." <br /><br />I don't know.<br /><br />There were gorgeous sentences. Like:<br /><br /><i>I had a glimpse of things from her standpoint, of how it was one thing to have a young man for your happy friend in the rosy days of love, and quite different the faulty creature to face in practical weather.</i><br /><br />and:<br /><br /><i>If wit and discontent don't necessarily go together, it wasn't from the old woman that I learned it.</i><br /><br />And because Augie narrates his story in a self-reflective voice, the reader--well, this reader--can't help searching whether there is something of Augie in himself. <i>I thought this was like me and my life--I could not find myself in love without it should have some peculiarity.</i><br /><br />Oh, it's smart, even profound. Maybe if I had read it when meekly challenged by Mr. Mitchell I would have loved it more. But that was then and this is now. I've had many other Adventures (and Misadventures) since. <br /><br />The world turns. It won't happen--these things don't happen to me--but I can imagine someone cradling this book and asking me, "The bald eagle? So greatly admired and, yet, when the lizard bit back, he proved a coward. It's . . . I mean . . . is it us?" <br /><br />I thought so once. But that's too easy, isn't it? Have you read about my friend, the <i>Gaviero</i>?<br /><br /></span></div></div></div></section></section><section class="ReviewCard__tags"><ul class="CollapsableList"><a

Siena. The cathedral. Huh. 14th century popes with a licorish allsort fetish and way too much money. Okay, it was, you know, impressive. You could tell those popes wanted to be Alexander McQueen and they were all 6 centuries too early.<br> <br><img src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1437329608i/15572117._SX540_.jpg" class="gr-hostedUserImg" loading="lazy"><br>What, I hear you cry, does this have to do with Augie March, the mid 20th century Chicago likely lad? Only that I tiptoed out of the book and the cathedral with the same sour feeling. Sour and sore. I was beat. It was all too much. It was overpowering. I was done in, ears ringing. There was no volume control on either. They both need to be diluted. Well, for my weak taste, anyhow. All a bit much. Shouty. In your face. Neither were ever introduced to the idea of subtlety. Here’s a thing. I found an ebook of Augie March on youtube. They do that. I’da thought they’da got sued but no. I gave it a whirl then I gave it up. But at least I knew what the problem was. <br><br>Augie March is of course quite brilliant, but it was a kind of brilliance which felt like force-feeding the pore old reader. Bellow eyes up his readers like French farmers eye up the geese they’re going to get the foix gras out of. Okay, here we go, cram cram cram. The vocabulary is up in the higher nineties. Every last possible detail about everything in Augie’s life goes right down there on the page. It was like being trapped on an endless train journey with a classic bore who doesn’t know what details to leave out of a story and also doesn’t know what the point of his story is. But the bore is clearly some kind of borderline genius. On and on. And of course he assumes that everything about his life is interesting to everyone. Your classic bore behaviour. And it’s delivered in this first person monotone, the register never changes. Then this, then that. What was in the underwear drawer. What was on the toast.<br> <br>Now, we have had these infinite-detail impressive big novels-of-life-itself before. From my swag bag of novels I would pull out <i>Main Street</i> by Sinclair Lewis and <i>What I Lived For</i> by Joyce Carol Oates and <i>A House for Mr Biswas</i> by VS Naipaul, not to mention Richard Price’s gargantuan inch-by-inch explorations of a handful of urban days and nights in his three huge police procedurals – I mean, <i>Ulysses</i> itself is one of these every-tiny-thing is-going-in masterblasters. I mention ones that I love. So you see I was very disappointed to find that although it’s quite clear this book is a masterpiece it just wasn’t … <br><br>for instance, young Augie goes to work as a general dogsbody for a disabled geezer called Einhorn, who is yeah a curious enough character &amp; he &amp; his dubious family take over Augie’s waking hours so the whole book then becomes about them and it just gets real dull real quick and stays dull too. This Einhorn is kind of interesting but not so we want to know the arse-end of every aspect of the five universes of Einhornity, which is what we get.<br><br>And yet – there are unspeakably great paragraphs here and there. Great great sentences that belong up on some wall. <br><br>But I’m making a mental note to try this one again in my next life.<br><br>Five star book, one star reader, therefore no rating

  <b>
    <i>I am an American, Chicago born - Chicago, that somber city - and go at things as I have taught myself, free-style, and will make the record in my own way: first to knock, first admitted; sometimes an innocent knock, sometimes a not so innocent.</i>
  </b>
</blockquote><br /><br />What an opening sentence, which manages to prefigure the entire novel - the frenetic energy of it, diverting this way and that, moving enigmatically from one idea to the next by an inscrutable trajectory. It is clear that Augie will make the record in his own way, and from the moment of introduction he proceeds to submerge the unprepared reader in a deluge of detail, a life story related as a life is lived: one event following the one before, this one followed then by another, then the next, relentlessly and with unceasing energy, the often banal minutiae of accumulated friends, lovers, enemies, successes, failures, hopes and anguishes - some are pivotal in Augie's life, but many simply pass through, never to be seen again, leaving barely a trace. The process is haphazard and tedious, relying solely on yet driven inexorably by the exuberance (an adjective overused in describing this book, but one that is nonetheless apt) and brilliance of the writing. <br /><br />This is the impression formed within the first one hundred pages, and yet the novel persists exactly in this vein for a further four hundred or more. However at some point what has felt like a barrage begins to pass through you in the same way that life passes through you, simply as a series of occurrences, experienced in succession, with one standing at the focus trying to make sense of it all. A life has no narrative arc; no clear culmination: when a story ends, life goes on and perhaps another story will begin.<br /><br /><i>The Adventures of Augie March</i> is grounded in a specific time and place that has been lost to history, and so much of the immediacy and currency of this novel has been correspondingly diminished. And yet the experience of Augie March somehow manages to transcend the somber Chicago of the depression and stand for something universal - it is the story of finding oneself, of trying to become, and of never really knowing if you got there, or if you ever will.</span></div></div></div></section></section><section class="ReviewCard__tags"><ul class="CollapsableList"><a

  <i>In the end you can't save your soul and life by thought. But if you think, the least of the consolation prizes is the world.</i>
</blockquote>I may be American, but I am not Chicago born. Nor am I male, or of the generation that grew up in the roar of the twenties and came into adulthood soon after the crash. My life, and more importantly my perspective on said life, would be much different creatures than the ones I currently clamber around on. I think, though, they would've been much like Augie's, on an axis to the unknown that is neither guaranteed to exist nor enviable in its existence.<br /><br />For what I value above all else is a sense of justified living, some measure of verifiable existence that is not constrained any more than what the soul can bear. By soul I suppose I mean mind, but in this age that word is as vague and unreliable as its theological precursor, albeit with less inherent worth in its connotations. Also, the soul is more easily imagined as something that can be acted upon, strung along wires and ripped clean out of the body on more than one occasion recounted in ancient texts and popular fiction. You can lose your mind, as the saying goes, but not everyone can step back and observe the chattering box of their ego, superego, and id. They think they can, but it's one thing to observe the effects of ideologies on others, and a much more convoluted and unpleasant process to disconnect the self and measure the personality. For where are the boundaries, the limits, the safety nets and sign posts? So I will stick with the word soul, and make use of its improved flexibility.<br /><br />Augie can see these effects, whether by the immense amount of life experience or by the scraps of formal education that he's managed to gather. He doesn't have any words for what he's seeing, the driving force of civilization on the individual, the socioeconomic machine grinding the niches and slotting the personas, piece by piece, human being by human being. But he can sense them. It is true that he is highly suspect to being carried away by forces of personality, ones who have wound themselves so tightly into their respective places that they corkscrew all of the littler beings around them into a tight cyclone of centralized activity. The difference with Augie is that when he nears the center, he does not get stuck in the cogs and crannies. Instead, he lets loose, and the centripetal acceleration carries him far, far away, until he is caught up by yet another great typhoon and loses himself in the whirling midst.<br /><br />Is that considered failure? To see what happens to those who 'specialize' in the grand scheme of things, and be frightened by it? To experience the failure of something that was of the utmost certainty, and forever more shy away from the best laid plans of mice and men? To live, to learn, to love, and have each and every path point towards a nonexistent final solution, falsely promise a conclusive fate? <br /><br />The world is not ready for the Augies. The world is not ready for a rambling persona with little sophistication and great empathetic intelligence, someone sensitive to the delicate meters of the psyche and obstinate in the defense of their soul. Someone who cannot put into words the ever shifting balance of relief and discontent with their existence, seemingly carried on the backs of others while in truth pulling against an ever strengthening tide. Someone who rides the rails into a jail cell, names an eagle Caligula, forsakes the steady career at all turns and quotes Plato during their mental crises. A never-do-well and good-hearted philosopher, welcomed into homes while on the constant search for their own, who cannot describe their desire to others in a society-sanctioned manner but feels the constant pull of it on their soul.<blockquote>
  <i>I headed downtown right away. It was still early in the evening, glittering with electric, with ice; and trembling in the factories, those nearly all windows, over the prairies that had returned over demolitions with winter grass pricking the snow and thrashed and frozen together into beards by the wind. The cold simmer of the lake also, blue; the steady skating of rails too, down to the dark.</i>
</blockquote>Down into the dark, down into the laden senses, conveyed in a romantic style among the concrete jungle, a precious mental note of beauty amongst the tough old exteriors of cold and grit. There's no saving here. There's the thought. And, therein, lies the world.</span></div></div></div></section></section><section class="ReviewCard__tags"><ul class="CollapsableList"><a

As he makes his way to a full brimming consciousness of himself, Augie careens himself through numberless occupations, and countless mentors and exemplars, all the while enchanting us with the slapdash American music of his voice.","primaryContributorEdge":{"__typename":"BookContributorEdge","node":{"__ref":"Contributor:kca://author/amzn1.gr.author.v1.vSYuPcOXA8_XKD3rnz6huw"},"role":"Author"},"secondaryContributorEdges":[{"__typename":"BookContributorEdge","node":{"__ref":"Contributor:kca://author/amzn1.gr.author.v1.nnma6w8EysMKR9BZ-jlheA"},"role":"Introduction"}],"imageUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388270246i/11908.jpg","bookSeries":[],"bookGenres":[{"__typename":"BookGenre","genre":{"__typename":"Genre","name":"Fiction","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/genres/fiction"}},{"__typename":"BookGenre","genre":{"__typename":"Genre","name":"Classics","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/genres/classics"}},{"__typename":"BookGenre","genre":{"__typename":"Genre","name":"Literature","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/genres/literature"}},{"__typename":"BookGenre","genre":{"__typename":"Genre","name":"Novels","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/genres/novels"}},{"__typename":"BookGenre","genre":{"__typename":"Genre","name":"American","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/genres/american"}},{"__typename":"BookGenre","genre":{"__typename":"Genre","name":"Literary

But a man’s character is his fate, says Heraclitus, and in the end there isn’t any way to disguise the nature of the knocks by acoustical work on the door or gloving the knuckles.”\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eWhen I worked in a bookstore in Phoenix, there was this judge who frequently came in, usually late at night to buy stacks of books. He was a voracious reader. He had been in the OSS in WW2 and was one of the officers involved in the arrest of Hermann Göring. As he said, “I actually laid hands on the man.” Needless to say, the judge was one of the smartest and most interesting guys I’ve ever met. One slow night, I hadn’t seen a customer in over an hour. I was lounging at the register, reading Saul Bellow, and the judge came in. He was so tickled I was reading Augie March, the best book he’d ever read about growing up in the depression. The Odyssey of the modern era. What baffled me the most was when this ultra successful guy says to me...I wish I’d had March’s life. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eSuccess lays its own traps for us. We find ourselves frog marched along until the next thing we know the whole world would think we were insane to want to be anything other than what we have become. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eI found the going tough in March, and even though this guy I admired so much had endorsed it so vigorously, at some point, I set the book aside, not to return to it for 33 years. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eJudge, wherever you are now...I finished \u003ci\u003eThe Adventures of Augie March\u003c/i\u003e! The weight of this reading indiscretion has been lifted from my shoulders. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eI don’t know that Bellow set out to write a masterpiece as he started stacking the pages of this novel. He might have just been having a lot of fun. The whacky, freewheeling style of the novel has me comparing certain aspects of it to \u003ci\u003eCatch-22\u003c/i\u003e. The comedic elements, subtle but constant, keeps even the most tragic of circumstances that Augie finds himself ensnared from becoming too heavy. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThroughout the novel Augie is encouraged to go to University and does frequently consider it, usually when events have conspired against him. Going to school is frankly just too rigid a system for him. It is why he can’t hold down a regular job and why he is attracted to skilless jobs as long as he has more freedom of movement. He starts working for a man he would admire for the rest of his life, named Einhorn, while still in high school. \u003ci\u003e”’What would Caesar suffer in this case? What would Machiavelli advise or Ulysses do? What would Einhorn think? I’m not kidding when I enter Einhorn in this eminent list.”\u003c/i\u003e Einhorn is far from being on the up and up. He is a cripple who manages his affairs from a wheelchair but seems to be able to see the workings of the world very clearly, even if he isn’t able to see it for himself. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAnother example of a nontraditional job that Augie holds for a while is stealing books. He is supposed to sell them on to the customers who requested them, but he refuses to give the books up until he has read them. He suffers from a spat of bibliophilia that is nearly impossible to shake off. His partner in crime even offers him his library card. He wants him to check the books out of the library instead. \u003cb\u003e”But somehow that wasn’t the same. As eating your own meal.”\u003c/b\u003e Ahh yes, there is a difference. There is, in my experience, always a stronger bond established between a reader and a book they own. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAugie falls in love/lust over and over again. His first big love/lust was Esther Fenchel. \u003ci\u003e”I say, without a push of love and worship in my bowels at the curve of her hips, and triumphant maiden shape behind, and soft, protected secret. Where, to be allowed with love, would be the endorsement of the world, that it was not the barren confusion distant dry fears hinted and whispered, but was necessary, justified, the justification proved by joy. That if she would have, approve, kiss, use her hands on me, allow me the clay dust of the court from her legs, the mild sweat, her intimate dirt and sweat, deliver me from suffering falsehood--show that there wasn’t anything false, injurious, or empty-hearted that couldn’t be corrected!”\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eDoes anyone else have the urge to fix those sentences?\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eOf course, he is basing all this rather courtly devotion to her on her most shallow attributes. Her sister Thea circles around the love sick Augie unnoticed in the glow emanating from her sister. She realizes his desires for her sister are hopeless, and she feels she is the better match for Augie. In a book full of crazy decisions, probably one of the most insane that Augie gets himself involved in is a wild trip to Mexico, featuring Thea and Caligula the eagle. It is a cocked up mess from beginning to end. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e“‘You’ve lost a tooth.’ I nodded. I knew where the gap was. But sooner or later you’re bound to lose some teeth.”\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAugie has a chance to be rich more than once, but if there is one thing that he can be counted on to do….it is to make the wrong decision. A rich couple even offers to adopt him as their son. This would have made him a rich man for life. He refuses, unwilling to be a family pet, even if it does mean a lifetime of financial security. Honorable? Well yes, you could make that case, but given the staccato bizarreness of his life, it might have been a very prudent offer to accept. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eDuring the war, the army doesn’t want him. He joins the Merchant Marine to do his bit. Of course, he doesn’t know that the Merchant Marine suffers the highest casualty rates of the war, and sure enough his ship is bombed by a torpedo. Augie finds himself in a raft with an insane genius who doesn’t want to be saved but only wants to find an island to continue his research. Only Augie, out of the hundreds of men on the ship, could end up in a boat with the most barmy of the lot. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe book ends with Augie living in France with Stella. She is trying to make a go of being an actress, and Augie is involved in some shady dealings. I can sense that Augie is looking towards the horizon, dreaming about the experiences and adventures that await him just over the curve of the earth. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eWikipedia has a great summary of this book. \u003ci\u003e”With an intricate plot and allusive style, Bellow explores contrasting themes of alienation and belonging, poverty and wealth, love and loss, with often comic undertones.”\u003c/i\u003e Because Augie is so free spirited, impossible to chain down in any profession or relationship, Bellow has an opportunity, through this character, to evaluate every nugget of human experience. Saul Bellow was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1976, and this book was mentioned as his greatest contribution to literature. Masterpiece? Of course, it is. The Judge couldn’t possibly be wrong. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003e\n  \u003cb\u003e”In yourself you labor, you wage and combat, settle scores, remember insults, fight, reply, deny, blab, denounce, triumph, outwit, overcome, vindicate, cry, persist, absolve, die and rise again.

It consists of 26 complete, well-defined chapters, but it doesn’t follow any preconceived linear plot. It contains a hero, in fact, many heroes, but it doesn’t consist of a traditional three act hero’s journey.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt’s not precisely crafted in the sense that what we read, the life experiences, have been heavily edited, abridged, distilled and selected, so that much life has been left out and what remains is the bare minimum the author could say.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eInstead, much, much life has been left in, and what’s been said about that life is precisely crafted. It’s what Bellow needed and wanted to say about everything around him.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBellow didn’t invite us into a cinema, sit us in a seat, turn out the lights and exclude the outside world, so that we could focus on his art.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eInstead, he removed the ceiling, the walls and all of the obstacles that might block our sight, so that we could see and experience the real world, real people and real life. The book teems with reality, with realism, so much so that Bellow’s brother, Maurice, refused to speak to him for five years after its publication.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis novel, this filmic experience, this thought process might be longer than what is conventional. If that bothers you, this might not be the book for you. But if it doesn’t, then, like me, you might find it one of the most rewarding reading experiences of your life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eA Smorgasbord, Not for the Smorgasbored\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e“Augie March” is a smorgasbord, not a TV dinner. It’s not pre-packaged and pre-digested. It invites you to focus and observe and think and enjoy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt’s expansive, sprawling, discursive, in the sense of \"fluent and expansive rather than formulaic or abbreviated\". \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSometimes, it seems to be a directionless wander, other times a wild ride. Augie is a wonder boy with a wanderlust. But at all times, Augie’s quest is singular, like Christopher Columbus, to discover America, the world, and through it, himself. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou might not enjoy this novel, unless you can relate to his quest, his adventures and his discoveries, unless you can imagine yourself on board the \"Pinta\", the \"Nina\" or the \"Santa Maria\", setting sail for some unknown, far horizon. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI urge you not to embark, if you are easily bored or fear you might want to jump ship mid-voyage or mid-adventure. The novel is ship-shape. It would take only you to torpedo it. It would break my heart to read yet another uncomprehending three star (or less) review of this brilliant and important novel. But if you’re not deterred, welcome aboard!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eA Picaresque Without a Picaro\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow that it’s just you and me, let’s talk about Augie, baby, and his adventures.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMany critics describe \"Augie March\" as a picaresque novel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Spanish word \"picaro\" means a rogue or a rascal. The Wiki definition mentions that a picaresque narrative is usually a first person autobiographical account; the main character is often of low character or social class; and there is little if any character development in the main character, whose circumstances may change but rarely result in a change of heart.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe reference in the title to \"adventures\" hints at this narrative tradition, as does Augie’s lower class orphan social status.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, Augie isn’t just content to let things happen to him. He’s not passive. He goes where his quest takes him. He is not there by accident or fate. What happens there might not have happened if he had remained at home. His experiences and adventures are a direct response to his quest.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eAchievement Without Lineage\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJust as there is little or no narrative linearity in the novel, Augie has no familial lineage of any grandeur.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBellow strips him of his father. Augie is \"the by-blow of a travelling man\" (a child born out of wedlock). He has no recollection of his father.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNevertheless, Augie’s mother is responsible for three boys and a dog, and family love is at the heart of the novel:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci\u003e\"Georgie Mahchy, Augie, Simey\u003cbr\u003eWinnie Mahchy, evwy, evwy love Mama.\"\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMama is not a strong-willed, domineering matriarchal type in the Jewish tradition. The mantle of that role is assumed by Grandma Lausch, not a blood relative, but a Russian (Odessa) lodger, \"boss-woman, governing hand, queen mother, empress\" and major influence who wants what is best in life for Augie and his brothers. She sees potential for greatness in the boys and wants them to aspire and succeed to greatness.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo this extent, the novel is about the achievement of aspirations, both internal and external.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAugie’s quest is for material independence and love. If he achieves these two things, he will have learned the meaning of his life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHaving achieved himself, he will leave a heritage, a legacy for his own family. He will have commenced an empire, a lineage of his own.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eNobility Without Savagery\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe single word that captures both of Augie’s aspirations is \"nobility\".\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA key metaphor in the novel is the difference between nobility and savagery.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are all part of the Animal Kingdom, but what separates humanity (human beings) from the other animals is the capacity for thought, the ability to be dignified, sophisticated, social, cultured, marvellous, refined, sublime and civilized, the tendency to explore, discover, invent, create, learn and teach.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is our nobility, what separates us not just from animal savagery, but human savagery (such as was to be experienced in the Holocaust).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile I understand Augie’s name is pronounced \"Or-gie\", I can’t get out of the habit of pronouncing \"Augie\" as \"Ow-gie\" in the German fashion (like I suspect Grandma Lausch did).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAugie’s name is presumably short for August, which hints of the noble in its own right, for example, the name Augustus (Caesar), but more likely in the adjective \"august\" (\"inspiring reverence or admiration; of supreme dignity or grandeur; majestic\") and its Latin etymology (augustus: \"venerable, majestic, magnificent, noble,\" probably originally \"consecrated by the augurs, with favorable auguries\").\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith all of these personal aspirations and social expectations, it’s crucial that Augie succeed, that he triumph in life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe outcome he fears most is failure. He can’t bear the thought of being a \"flop\".\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn this way, his adventure with first real love, Thea, in Mexico with an eagle that hunts iguanas and snakes is symbolic of Augie’s own plight.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe eagle is called Caligula, after the Roman Emperor, but equally importantly, the Spanish word for eagle is \"águila\", which doesn’t take much contortion to become Augie.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis eagle should be the most noble and august of birds, yet it fails to achieve its purpose. In the eyes of the township, it becomes the flop that Augie feared.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eA Man’s Character is His Fate\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAugie’s great advantage is that he is a good listener, \"clever junge\", bright, intelligent, hopeful, optimistic, eager, [mostly] honest, \"ehrlich\", loyal, strong, tough, robust, sensual, handsome and grows to be 5' 11\" (four inches taller than Bellow himself, thus achieving one of the author’s personal aspirations). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHe also feels both obliged (or obligated) in the pursuit of his own self-improvement, and obliging in the support of others.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf anything, his greatest risk is that others can easily take advantage of him, his friendship and his generosity.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is not to say he is an easy con. It is his nature, his character, and in the words of Heraclitus, \"a man’s character is his fate.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eA Woman’s Influence on a Man’s Fate\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile Augie’s adventures are necessarily masculine, women play a vital role at every step as mother (Mama, Grandma Lausch, Mrs Renling), lover (Lucy, Sophie, Thea, Stella) and friend (Mimi).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMrs Renling is almost as ambitious for Augie as Grandma Lausch: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci\u003e\"An educated man with a business is a lord.\"\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCousin Anna Coblin shares the view that Augie deserves to succeed: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci\u003e\"You should know only happiness, as you deserve.\"\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eWorking Class Politics\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eOne of Augie’s mentors, Mr Einhorn points out that he is a contrarian:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci\u003e\"This was the first time that anyone had told me anything like the truth about myself. I felt it powerfully. That, as he said, I did have opposition in me, and great desire to offer resistance and to say 'No!' which was as clear as could be, as definite a feeling as a pang of hunger.\"\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAugie spends some of his apprenticeship in life as a union organiser. He is good at it and popular, except with rival unions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLike Bellow himself, Augie reads up on Marx and becomes an anti-Stalinist Trotskyist for a while. He even sees Trotsky in Mexico from a distance, just days before his assassination. (Bellow himself missed meeting Trotsky by days.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, Augie’s heart is not behind the cause at this grass roots level, especially when he has unresolved issues with Thea to deal with.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eThe Universal Eligibility to Be Noble\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was always disappointed that, in his later novels, Bellow became less left-wing and more conservative and curmudgeonly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo a certain extent, he moved with the times, in response to revelations about the reality of Soviet Communism and the invasions of Hungary and Czechoslovakia.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don’t think he ever became a fully-fledged Neo-Conservative, more what we called an Anti-Anti-Communist, someone who was sympathetic to the Left, but was not a supporter of McCarthyite tactics.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHe was a writer, not an activist. Like Augie, to quote James Atlas, he was more interested in experiencing \"life’s intellectual, aesthetic and sensual pleasures\".\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, more specifically, in terms of Augie’s worldview, what both author and character seemed to believe in was \"the universal eligibility to be noble\".\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThey were not so much concerned with the primacy of Equality, whether of outcome or income, but the equal opportunity to achieve Nobility in all the senses that make a human civilized and a civilization great.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003e\"I am an American, Chicago Born\"\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis might all sound very obvious and trite to you, but I first read \"Augie March\", when I was defining my own political and cultural views, and Bellow’s and Augie’s example was absolutely vital to me, especially because, part of my own intellectual development occurred in an anti-intellectual context, where it was reassuring to know that intelligence and personal dynamism could be combined successfully in one person.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe other reason I am so protective and assertive of the merits of this novel is what it represented in the America of 1953.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBellow was a Jew, a member of a race that had been denied entry into society, members clubs, golf clubs, academia and the cultural intelligentsia.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBellow’s third, most ambitious novel burst onto the American literary scene with the following memorable words:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci\u003e\"I am an American, Chicago born…and go at things as I have taught myself, free-style, and will make the record in my own way: first to knock, first admitted.\"\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAugie was asserting his own Americanness, opposed to any attempt to marginalize him because of his racial or religious background.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHe was an American, first, a Jew, an American Jew. There was no inconsistency between the two qualities. He was proud to be both. He was proud to be the one.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I recently read and reviewed \"The Great Gatsby\", I wrote about a Capitalist America, that survived and arguably thrived in some way by maintaining an exclusivity.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePerhaps, Gatsby’s only failure, the reason he could grasp the American Dream as a Holy Grail and find that it disintegrated in his hands, was that he didn’t realise that he wasn’t welcome by those who were already at the top.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn a way, Jay Gatsby handed the baton onto Augie March, who then insisted on making his way through those doors wedged closed, so that more people could follow him and have their contribution to America recognised and respected.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhereas \"The Great Gatsby\" describes exclusion, \"Augie March\" conveys a message of inclusion, not necessarily assimilation, but co-existence in harmony of purpose and outcome.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo \"Augie March\" was a major assertion and achievement for an American Jew, an even greater achievement when the novel won the National Book Award for the most distinguished American novel of 1953.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am still more sentimental about this book than \"Herzog\" or \"Humboldt’s Gift\", and therefore I am motivated to say that \"Augie March\" was a large part of the argument for Bellow’s entitlement to receive the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1976.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am not an American, I am not Chicago born, I am not a Jew. However, the thing about \"Augie March\", this book written by a 38 year old American Jew, almost 20 years younger than I am now, is that it resounded with me all this way across the world, once upon a time 20 years after it was written, then again 60 years after it was written, and during every moment in between and for every moment during which my heart might beat and my mind might imagine afterwards.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eFree-Style, In My Own Way\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt wasn’t just the subject matter that appealed to me, though that would have been enough. It was the language.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBellow’s first sentence announced his modus operandi: he wasn’t going to be constrained by convention, he was going to write free-style, in his own way, autodidactically, because he wanted to communicate what he had learned himself, rather than being taught.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs it turned out, he wrote like he spoke. It didn’t read like it was written, it sounded like it was said and we were listening to it. Augie could speak as if in the street, as if in a bar, as if in a club. It was entertaining, persuasive, informative, endearing, inspiring. Even when most intellectual, his words were still beautiful to listen to.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis was no smug Ivy League belletrist pronouncing from the comfort and security of his study. As Bellow has revealed, not a word of this novel was written in Chicago. This was a man jotting down the intricate workings of his mind while sailing across the Atlantic or sitting drinking coffee in a Parisian or Mediterranean cafe.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLike Joyce’s portrait of Dublin, this was Chicago and New York remembered from afar, painted from memory, complete with its own deli sights and smells and Yiddish rhythms and intonation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBellow never descended into purple prose. Everything seemed to be in exactly the right place, as required to communicate effectively. Yet frequently, I wondered at the beauty of his prose, speculating on whether anybody had ever used this combination of simple words in this precise way before.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI'll leave you with a random sampling of sentences that appealed:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci\u003e\"I have always tried to become what I am.\"\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci\u003e\"I have a feeling with respect to the axial lines of life, with respect to which you must be straight or else your existence is merely clownery, hiding tragedy.\"\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003ci\u003e\"Happy as a god.\"\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci\u003e\"You are the author of your own death.

The unending cycle of crises that began with the First World War has formed a kind of person, one who has lived through terrible, strange things, and in whom there is an observable shrinkage of prejudices, a casting off of disappointing ideologies, an ability to live with many kinds of madness, an immense desire for certain durable human goods - truth, for instance, or freedom, or wisdom. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"I don't think I am exaggerating; there is plenty of evidence for this.

Augie is launched on the world like a modern day Huckleberry Finn crossed with Tom Jones. But Augie’s arc does not quite have their level of comic edge, the moral quandaries of Huck or pursuit of women like Tom. Scrambling like a chameleon from one odd job or scheme to another he passes from one mentor to another, then breaks free but never quite grows up. He was a great inspiration for me, always aspiring to better himself and try something new and able to keep in flight without crashing after hard knocks.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eHe starts from humble beginnings of poverty in the depression-era Chicago melting pot, with an absent father and a neglectful mother he describes as “simple minded”. His guidance by a controlling Russian immigrant boarder, Anna Lausch, assumes the proportions of that of a typical mother and a label as “Grandma”. As we see in Wells’ “The Glass Castle”, the major life skill she imparts is the ability to manipulate others and, of equal importance, to see through the ploys of others. When he is nine, she engages him with a role in a caper to assure the optometrist will give his mother free glasses. He older brother Simon was not up to the lying required as he saw the world in the black and white of a Boy Scout. Augie is a natural at such dissembling:\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eI could be counted on to do the job, because I enjoyed it. I loved a piece of strategy. I had enthusiasms too; I had Simon’s …, and I had Grandma Lausch’s as well.\u003c/i\u003e \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe “enthusiasms” referred to in Augie’s reflections (from late in life as our narrator) point the moral grounding he got from his brother’s noble aspirations. His love and empathy for his younger brother, Georgie, who is cognitively handicapped, contributes to another humanizing influence on Augie’s character. His ersatz grandmother is stunning in Bellow’s marvelous portrayal, the epitome of a larger-than-life character:\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eShe was as wrinkled as an old paper bag, an autocrat, hard-shelled and Jesuitical, a punchy old hawk of a Bolshevik, her small ribboned gray feet immobile on the shoekit and stool Simon had made in the manual-training class, dingy old wool Winnie whose bad smell filled the flat on the cushion beside her. If wit and discontent don’t necessarily go together, it wasn’t from the old woman that I learned it. She was impossible to satisfy.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eIn retrospect Augie is able to see she was “one of those Machiavellis of small street and neighborhood that my young years were full of”, but at the time he took to heart many of her lessons, including a solid work ethic and a wariness over pursuit of love:\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003e”You don’t know what’s coming if you think you can get by with laughing and eating peach pie.”\u003cbr /\u003e…\u003cbr /\u003e“Nobody asks you to love the whole world, only to be honest, \u003cu\u003eehrlich\u003c/u\u003e. Don’t have a loud mouth. The more you love people the more they’ll mix you up. A child loves, a person respects. Respect is better than love.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eBy age 14 the critical lesson he is learning has to do with shaping one’s fate through applying oneself in work. Here he bounces back after being squelched in exploring music:\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eAnd when Anna snatched Howard’s saxophone, my thought was, “Go on. Take it. What do I want it for! I’ll do better than that. “ My mind was already dwelling on a good enough fate.\u003cbr /\u003eWhile the old lady, following her own idea of what that fate would be, continued to find various jobs for me.\u003cbr /\u003eSaying “various jobs,” I gave out the Rosetta stone, so to speak, to my entire life.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eFrom menial jobs like busboy or bellhop or dog training, Augie moves on to dabbling with robbery and graduates to an assistant and virtual son to a wealthy and powerful businessmen and later to an aristocrat with a love of expensive horses. This subsuming himself to others gets him in trouble, and he learns to invest himself in his own initiatives. But it takes him longer to get his balance when it comes to success over subjugations of love. At one extreme, he finds himself helping his strange girlfriend using an eagle to hunt iguanas in a Mexican desert. And in helping another woman escape an abusive relationship he jeopardizes his tenuous standing with the one he aspires to. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eI love how even though Augie dropped out of school, he is always reading and is always trying to forge lessons out of life. I find him to have the same kind of warm-hearted, questing outlook as Richard Ford’s Frank Bascom. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eAs long as I could keep improving my mind, I figured, I was doing okay.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAugie embodies the American dream of the potential to grab opportunities and become a self-made man. Though he never achieves a stable success or even clear goals for himself, his ability to keep morphing in the face of changing circumstances makes him a new kind of American hero. He has a lot of chutzpah blended with an admirable humility:\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eEveryone tries to create a world he can live in, and what he can't use he often can't see. But the real world is already created, and if your fabrication doesn't correspond, then even if you feel noble and insist on there being something better than what people call reality, that better something needn't try to exceed what, in its actuality, since we know it so little, may be very surprising. If a happy state of things, surprising; if miserable or tragic, no worse than what we invent.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe literary experts pin Augie’s adventures down as “picaresque”, which Wiki charts from a Spanish tradition (think Cervantes) as tales of a “roguish hero of low social class who lives by his wits in a corrupt society.” There is some element of truth to the generalization on the form:\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003e There is little if any character development in the main character. Once a picaro, always a picaro. His or her circumstances may change but they rarely result in a change of heart.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eBut I believe Augie’s character gained in wisdom and independence over time. And I don’t see the satire or the comic, delusional hopelessness in his arc as we see with “Don Quixote”. He is closer to Jim Harrison’s “Brown Dog”, a rascal with heart, more a giver than a taker. I like to think that Augie learned to play like Brown Dog, found true love, and came to savor the rewards of “laughing and eating peach pie.”","rating":5,"shelving":{"__typename":"Shelving","shelf":{"__typename":"Shelf","name":"read","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/4086118?shelf=read"},"taggings":[{"__typename":"Tagging","tag":{"__typename":"Tag","name":"chicago","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/4086118?shelf=chicago"}}],"webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1197632422"},"likeCount":66,"viewerHasLiked":null,"commentCount":17,"viewerCanComment({\"resourceType\":\"review\"})":null},"Book:kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.YYtoaPG36TLDIz0PZGrotQ":{"id":"kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.YYtoaPG36TLDIz0PZGrotQ","__typename":"Book"},"User:1107219":{"id":1107219,"__typename":"User","legacyId":1107219,"imageUrlSquare":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/users/1582301234i/1107219._UX200_CR0,0,200,200_.jpg","isAuthor":false,"textReviewsCount":150,"viewableName":"Jimmy","isBlockedByViewer":false,"webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1107219-jimmy","contributor":null,"isFollowing":false,"isFriend":false,"followersCount":168},"Review:kca://review:goodreads/amzn1.gr.review:goodreads.v1.qtkTfDzklabDW0crlLHaMA":{"id":"kca://review:goodreads/amzn1.gr.review:goodreads.v1.qtkTfDzklabDW0crlLHaMA","__typename":"Review","book":{"__ref":"Book:kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.YYtoaPG36TLDIz0PZGrotQ"},"creator":{"__ref":"User:1107219"},"recommendFor":null,"updatedAt":1618804068643,"createdAt":1222539033000,"spoilerStatus":false,"lastRevisionAt":1350072993000,"text":"Saul Bellow's \u003ci\u003ethe Adventures of Augie March\u003c/i\u003e is one of three things; it's either Saul Bellow's most verbose novel, a piece of fiction that almost stands as an historical document of Chicago during the Great Depression, or one of the best contemporary examples of the picaresque novel. Either way it's good and bad, and lovely and sprawling, and a testament to Bellow's fascination with the life that emanated from Chicago in the fifties.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAugie, the protagonist of the story, is a tramp to say the least; the archetypal schlemil, drifting his way through life, partially making an attempt to please his family, yet at the same time basically trying to enjoy himself. Bellow's portrayal of this character is at times painful to read, and at the same time ridiculously sympathetic. There should be an emphasis on the term \"character\" here because Augie exemplifies what seems lost and maybe completely absent from the sort of post-war fiction that would follow novels such as \u003ci\u003eAugie March\u003c/i\u003e, as well as that transitional novel of timeless greatness that is \u003ci\u003ethe Recognitions\u003c/i\u003e. He's a man who (tactfully juxtaposed by Bellow with his seemingly more level-headed brother Simon) can't seem to succeed, or rather simply doesn't want to. It's not that Augie is necessarily precocious or so determinately street clever, but it's because Augie's concept of the American dream is so freewheeling, and such an experimental riff on what it supposedly should be, that he can't seem to commit himself to one thing. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThroughout the story we follow Augie as he at first earnestly, and eventually in a listless manner, pursues a series of jobs that never seem to offer enough of a sense of fulfillment. He's often shamed by his grandmother, clearly usurping the role of his feeble mother, to the point where his connection with his family eventually becomes a restraint; one that holds him back from doing whatever it is that he seems to want to do in life. This existential paradox, contained within the historical context of depression-era Chicago, is what essentially breathes life into this picaresque tale of self-discovery and struggle. However, the reader has to eventually wonder where these questions are to take them in understanding Bellow's commentary on the aimless nature of Augie's time and place.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eAugie March\u003c/i\u003e is undoubtedly Bellow's longest and most stylistically liberal piece of fiction. A superficial page count alone, outweighs the rest of his novels. And its style is more beat-language oriented than anything else that he's ever written. One can't help but be struck by the excessive lengthiness of his prose here, not to mention the clearly subjective tone and ostensibly autobiographical essence of the story. It hurts this wonderful book in a serious way. Finding Augie endearing is almost inescapable or obvious, but finding the narrative that Bellow feels the need to draw out to an almost irrelevant degree is much less appealing. This is because, in so many ways, Bellow ends up sounding redundant in narrating examples in which Augie fails and succeeds. For a novel so full of adventurous vignettes, some of them seem less important than others. And toward the end, the reader can't help but clearly ascertain the heavy-handed emphasis of Augie's inability to adapt to the real world; most certainly a Quixotic type character, and it's unlikely that Bellow, writing what can only be construed as a novel in the picaresque fashion, had Cervantes in mind when molding Augie March. But length has never proved to be a detriment to an intentional narrative. Bellow's intentions are successful, and are conveyed in the most beautiful ways at times, but overall the story is basically indulgent, taking its time with passages of storytelling that basically overstay their welcome.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAnd yet, and yet, this is still someone who we appreciate because he is destined to fail. And failure is possibly even an inappropriate assessment of Augie. Maybe it's the sort of blind romanticism than was unavoidable for a character of Augie's individuality and charisma to have, more importantly, maybe it's just his nature to choose a path that, while exhilarating and just so full of life, inevitably leads him down roads that simply do no promise much of a future that looks ahead further than tomorrow or the next day. Whatever it is about this man, and even if Bellow goes to painful lengths to explain who Augie is, there's something about him that is such an exemplary version of the American spirit, to our shared concept of individual freedom, that we'd all be sore losers to say that it's unfeasible for any of us to see some static expression of hope and possibility in Augie March that we don't see in ourselves.","rating":3,"shelving":{"__typename":"Shelving","shelf":{"__typename":"Shelf","name":"read","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/1107219?shelf=read"},"taggings":[{"__typename":"Tagging","tag":{"__typename":"Tag","name":"fiction","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/1107219?shelf=fiction"}}],"webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/33973580"},"likeCount":59,"viewerHasLiked":null,"commentCount":5,"viewerCanComment({\"resourceType\":\"review\"})":null},"Book:kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.3E9AxO2Qww26FYoQckEoeQ":{"id":"kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.3E9AxO2Qww26FYoQckEoeQ","__typename":"Book"},"Contributor:kca://author/amzn1.gr.author.v1.decSido6yMT4GKXnRutbUA":{"id":"kca://author/amzn1.gr.author.v1.decSido6yMT4GKXnRutbUA","__typename":"Contributor","works":{"__typename":"ContributorWorksConnection","totalCount":3}},"User:48483884":{"id":48483884,"__typename":"User","legacyId":48483884,"imageUrlSquare":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/users/1576692048i/48483884._UX200_CR0,27,200,200_.jpg","isAuthor":true,"textReviewsCount":1655,"viewableName":"Michael Finocchiaro","isBlockedByViewer":false,"webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/48483884-michael-finocchiaro","contributor":{"__ref":"Contributor:kca://author/amzn1.gr.author.v1.decSido6yMT4GKXnRutbUA"},"isFollowing":false,"isFriend":false,"followersCount":4898},"Review:kca://review:goodreads/amzn1.gr.review:goodreads.v1.NRDCWaE5m5wWFxBhnugfEA":{"id":"kca://review:goodreads/amzn1.gr.review:goodreads.v1.NRDCWaE5m5wWFxBhnugfEA","__typename":"Review","book":{"__ref":"Book:kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.3E9AxO2Qww26FYoQckEoeQ"},"creator":{"__ref":"User:48483884"},"recommendFor":null,"updatedAt":1639443721108,"createdAt":1469947907000,"spoilerStatus":false,"lastRevisionAt":1528662099633,"text":"This book seems to be an underrated classic.

Augie is a fantastic Everyman who draws us in to his attempts at finding himself. I found particularly that the first climax in Mexico was very moving.

It is clear that Augie will make the record in his own way, and from the moment of introduction he proceeds to submerge the unprepared reader in a deluge of detail, a life story related as a life is lived: one event following the one before, this one followed then by another, then the next, relentlessly and with unceasing energy, the often banal minutiae of accumulated friends, lovers, enemies, successes, failures, hopes and anguishes - some are pivotal in Augie's life, but many simply pass through, never to be seen again, leaving barely a trace. The process is haphazard and tedious, relying solely on yet driven inexorably by the exuberance (an adjective overused in describing this book, but one that is nonetheless apt) and brilliance of the writing. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThis is the impression formed within the first one hundred pages, and yet the novel persists exactly in this vein for a further four hundred or more. However at some point what has felt like a barrage begins to pass through you in the same way that life passes through you, simply as a series of occurrences, experienced in succession, with one standing at the focus trying to make sense of it all. A life has no narrative arc; no clear culmination: when a story ends, life goes on and perhaps another story will begin.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eThe Adventures of Augie March\u003c/i\u003e is grounded in a specific time and place that has been lost to history, and so much of the immediacy and currency of this novel has been correspondingly diminished. And yet the experience of Augie March somehow manages to transcend the somber Chicago of the depression and stand for something universal - it is the story of finding oneself, of trying to become, and of never really knowing if you got there, or if you ever will.","rating":4,"shelving":{"__typename":"Shelving","shelf":{"__typename":"Shelf","name":"read","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/12933866?shelf=read"},"taggings":[{"__typename":"Tagging","tag":{"__typename":"Tag","name":"nobel-winners","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/12933866?shelf=nobel-winners"}},{"__typename":"Tagging","tag":{"__typename":"Tag","name":"literary-fiction","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/12933866?shelf=literary-fiction"}},{"__typename":"Tagging","tag":{"__typename":"Tag","name":"2016","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/12933866?shelf=2016"}}],"webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1431321261"},"likeCount":44,"viewerHasLiked":null,"commentCount":11,"viewerCanComment({\"resourceType\":\"review\"})":null},"User:4119460":{"id":4119460,"__typename":"User","legacyId":4119460,"imageUrlSquare":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/users/1635110819i/4119460._UY200_CR17,0,200,200_.jpg","isAuthor":false,"textReviewsCount":1162,"viewableName":"Aubrey","isBlockedByViewer":false,"webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4119460-aubrey","contributor":null,"isFollowing":false,"isFriend":false,"followersCount":569},"Review:kca://review:goodreads/amzn1.gr.review:goodreads.v1.c067izsTPuhXZTRv4mjAAA":{"id":"kca://review:goodreads/amzn1.gr.review:goodreads.v1.c067izsTPuhXZTRv4mjAAA","__typename":"Review","book":{"__ref":"Book:kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.8STGMVPymjeTc_ctXrguGA"},"creator":{"__ref":"User:4119460"},"recommendFor":null,"updatedAt":1619808464747,"createdAt":1335472663000,"spoilerStatus":false,"lastRevisionAt":1410920201000,"text":"4.5/5\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\n  \u003ci\u003eIn the end you can't save your soul and life by thought. But if you think, the least of the consolation prizes is the world.\u003c/i\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003eI may be American, but I am not Chicago born. Nor am I male, or of the generation that grew up in the roar of the twenties and came into adulthood soon after the crash. My life, and more importantly my perspective on said life, would be much different creatures than the ones I currently clamber around on. I think, though, they would've been much like Augie's, on an axis to the unknown that is neither guaranteed to exist nor enviable in its existence.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eFor what I value above all else is a sense of justified living, some measure of verifiable existence that is not constrained any more than what the soul can bear. By soul I suppose I mean mind, but in this age that word is as vague and unreliable as its theological precursor, albeit with less inherent worth in its connotations. Also, the soul is more easily imagined as something that can be acted upon, strung along wires and ripped clean out of the body on more than one occasion recounted in ancient texts and popular fiction. You can lose your mind, as the saying goes, but not everyone can step back and observe the chattering box of their ego, superego, and id. They think they can, but it's one thing to observe the effects of ideologies on others, and a much more convoluted and unpleasant process to disconnect the self and measure the personality. For where are the boundaries, the limits, the safety nets and sign posts? So I will stick with the word soul, and make use of its improved flexibility.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAugie can see these effects, whether by the immense amount of life experience or by the scraps of formal education that he's managed to gather. He doesn't have any words for what he's seeing, the driving force of civilization on the individual, the socioeconomic machine grinding the niches and slotting the personas, piece by piece, human being by human being. But he can sense them. It is true that he is highly suspect to being carried away by forces of personality, ones who have wound themselves so tightly into their respective places that they corkscrew all of the littler beings around them into a tight cyclone of centralized activity. The difference with Augie is that when he nears the center, he does not get stuck in the cogs and crannies. Instead, he lets loose, and the centripetal acceleration carries him far, far away, until he is caught up by yet another great typhoon and loses himself in the whirling midst.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eIs that considered failure? To see what happens to those who 'specialize' in the grand scheme of things, and be frightened by it? To experience the failure of something that was of the utmost certainty, and forever more shy away from the best laid plans of mice and men? To live, to learn, to love, and have each and every path point towards a nonexistent final solution, falsely promise a conclusive fate? \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe world is not ready for the Augies. The world is not ready for a rambling persona with little sophistication and great empathetic intelligence, someone sensitive to the delicate meters of the psyche and obstinate in the defense of their soul. Someone who cannot put into words the ever shifting balance of relief and discontent with their existence, seemingly carried on the backs of others while in truth pulling against an ever strengthening tide. Someone who rides the rails into a jail cell, names an eagle Caligula, forsakes the steady career at all turns and quotes Plato during their mental crises. A never-do-well and good-hearted philosopher, welcomed into homes while on the constant search for their own, who cannot describe their desire to others in a society-sanctioned manner but feels the constant pull of it on their soul.\u003cblockquote\u003e\n  \u003ci\u003eI headed downtown right away. It was still early in the evening, glittering with electric, with ice; and trembling in the factories, those nearly all windows, over the prairies that had returned over demolitions with winter grass pricking the snow and thrashed and frozen together into beards by the wind. The cold simmer of the lake also, blue; the steady skating of rails too, down to the dark.\u003c/i\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003eDown into the dark, down into the laden senses, conveyed in a romantic style among the concrete jungle, a precious mental note of beauty amongst the tough old exteriors of cold and grit. There's no saving here. There's the thought.

world.","rating":4,"shelving":{"__typename":"Shelving","shelf":{"__typename":"Shelf","name":"read","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/4119460?shelf=read"},"taggings":[{"__typename":"Tagging","tag":{"__typename":"Tag","name":"4-star","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/4119460?shelf=4-star"}},{"__typename":"Tagging","tag":{"__typename":"Tag","name":"reviewed","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/4119460?shelf=reviewed"}},{"__typename":"Tagging","tag":{"__typename":"Tag","name":"nobel-prize-people","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/4119460?shelf=nobel-prize-people"}},{"__typename":"Tagging","tag":{"__typename":"Tag","name":"prose-prose-prose","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/4119460?shelf=prose-prose-prose"}},{"__typename":"Tagging","tag":{"__typename":"Tag","name":"1-read-on-hand","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/4119460?shelf=1-read-on-hand"}},{"__typename":"Tagging","tag":{"__typename":"Tag","name":"person-of-everything","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/4119460?shelf=person-of-everything"}},{"__typename":"Tagging","tag":{"__typename":"Tag","name":"r-2013","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/4119460?shelf=r-2013"}},{"__typename":"Tagging","tag":{"__typename":"Tag","name":"r-goodreads","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/4119460?shelf=r-goodreads"}},{"__typename":"Tagging","tag":{"__typename":"Tag","name":"antidote-think-twice-read","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/4119460?shelf=antidote-think-twice-read"}},{"__typename":"Tagging","tag":{"__typename":"Tag","name":"antidote-think-twice-all","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/4119460?shelf=antidote-think-twice-all"}}],"webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/319404287"},"likeCount":43,"viewerHasLiked":null,"commentCount":38,"viewerCanComment({\"resourceType\":\"review\"})":null},"Work:kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.wymBeMcSO2_R9wM7R-O4Ig":{"id":"kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.wymBeMcSO2_R9wM7R-O4Ig","__typename":"Work","legacyId":2453177,"bestBook":{"__ref":"Book:kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.4SWbxrBVSV5kutj35DRYQA"},"details":{"__typename":"WorkDetails","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/work/2453177-the-adventures-of-augie-march","shelvesUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/work/shelves/2453177-the-adventures-of-augie-march","publicationTime":-513964800000,"originalTitle":"The
