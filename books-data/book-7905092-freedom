Walter Berglund were the new pioneers of old St. Paul—the gentrifiers, the hands-on parents, the avant-garde of the Whole Foods generation. Patty was the ideal sort of neighbor, who could tell you where to recycle your batteries and how to get the local cops to actually do their job. She was an enviably perfect mother and the wife of Walter's dreams. Together with Walter—environmental lawyer, commuter cyclist, total family man—she was doing her small part to build a better world.<br /><br />But now, in the new millennium, the Berglunds have become a mystery. Why has their teenage son moved in with the aggressively Republican family next door? Why has Walter taken a job working with Big Coal? What exactly is Richard Katz—outré rocker and Walter's college best friend and rival—still doing in the picture? Most of all, what has happened to Patty? Why has the bright star of Barrier Street become "a very different kind of neighbor," an implacable Fury coming unhinged before the street's attentive eyes?<br /><br />In his first novel since <i>The Corrections</i>, Jonathan Franzen has given us an epic of contemporary love and marriage. Freedom comically and tragically captures the temptations and burdens of liberty: the thrills of teenage lust, the shaken compromises of middle age, the wages of suburban sprawl, the heavy weight of empire. In charting the mistakes and joys of Freedom's characters as they struggle to learn how to live in an ever more confusing world, Franzen has produced an indelible and deeply moving portrait of our time.<br />(jacket)</span></div></div></div></div><div data-testid="genresList" class="BookPageMetadataSection__genres"><ul class="CollapsableList" aria-label="Top genres for this book"><span class="BookPageMetadataSection__genre"><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/genres/fiction" class="Button Button--tag-inline Button--medium"><span class="Button__labelItem">Fiction</span></a></span> <span class="BookPageMetadataSection__genre"><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/genres/contemporary" class="Button Button--tag-inline Button--medium"><span class="Button__labelItem">Contemporary</span></a></span> <span class="BookPageMetadataSection__genre"><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/genres/novels" class="Button Button--tag-inline Button--medium"><span class="Button__labelItem">Novels</span></a></span> <span class="BookPageMetadataSection__genre"><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/genres/literary-fiction" class="Button Button--tag-inline Button--medium"><span class="Button__labelItem">Literary Fiction</span></a></span> <div class="Button__container"><button type="button" class="Button Button--tag-inline Button--medium" aria-label="Show all items in the list"><span class="Button__labelItem">...more</span></button></div></ul></div><div class="BookDetails"><div class="CollapsableList"><span class="Text Text__body3"><div class="FeaturedDetails"><p data-testid="pagesFormat">562 pages, Hardcover</p><p data-testid="publicationInfo">First published August 1, 2010</p><p data-testid="awards"><span class="CollapsableList"><span data-testid="award"><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/award/show/87-warwick-prize-for-writing">Warwick Prize for Writing</a> Nominee<!-- -->, Longlist<span class="Text Text__subdued"> (2013)</span></span>, <span data-testid="award"><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/award/show/3812-los-angeles-times-book-prize">Los Angeles Times Book Prize</a> Nominee<!-- -->, Fiction<span class="Text Text__subdued"> (2010)</span></span>, <span data-testid="award"><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/award/show/5137-chicago-tribune-heartland-prize">Chicago Tribune Heartland Prize</a>, Fiction<span class="Text Text__subdued"> (2011)</span></span> <div class="Button__container"><button type="button" class="Button Button--inline Button--small" aria-label="Show all items in the list"><span class="Button__labelItem">...more</span></button></div></span></p></div></span> <div class="Button__container"><button type="button" class="Button Button--inline Button--small" aria-label="Show more book details"><span class="Button__labelItem">More details</span></button></div></div></div><hr class="Divider" role="presentation"/><div class="AuthorPreview"><div class="AuthorPreview__profile"><div class="AuthorPreview__avatar"><a class="Avatar Avatar--large" href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2578.Jonathan_Franzen" as="div"><img data-testid="image" class="Avatar__image" alt="Jonathan Franzen" src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/authors/1563172476i/2578._UX200_CR0,33,200,200_.jpg"/></a></div><div class="AuthorPreview__info"><h3 class="Text H3"><a class="ContributorLink" href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2578.Jonathan_Franzen"><span class="ContributorLink__name" data-testid="name">Jonathan Franzen</span></a></h3><div class="AuthorPreview__meta"><span class="Text Text__body3 Text__subdued">71<!-- --> <!-- -->books<span class="u-dot-before">7,464<!-- --> <!-- -->followers</span></span></div></div></div><div class="TruncatedText"><div class="TruncatedText__text TruncatedText__text--3" data-testid="contentContainer"><div><span class="Formatted">Jonathan Franzen is the author of <i>The Corrections</i>, winner of the 2001 National Book Award for fiction; the novels The <i>Twenty-Seventh City</i> and <i>Strong Motion</i>; and two works of nonfiction, <i>How to Be Alone</i> and <i>The Discomfort Zone</i>, all published by FSG.

class="ReviewText"><section class="ReviewText__content"><div class="TruncatedText"><div class="TruncatedText__text TruncatedText__text--5" data-testid="contentContainer"><div><span class="Formatted">I read <i>Freedom</i> the week before Christmas. What was I thinking? Did I want a bleak, almost sullen, portrayal of America in the new century? And not a complete one, either, but limited to privileged white people? Why didn’t I just sit on the couch, get drunk, and watch <i>Salt</i> and <i>Easy A</i>? Ok, I did that, too, but my kids were off of school and apparently believe they should get to watch television as well, so I went upstairs and read away a few afternoons. Stupid <i>Freedom</i>. Mr. Franzen, you’re good. Most writers couldn’t touch your talent. However, I think I’d rather read something less technically adept but also less dismal and self-involved. If <i>Freedom</i> were a teenager the novel would be that really smart and well-intentioned affluent kid worried about impressing Harvard in his application and doing community service at a soup kitchen but washing his hands about 100 times when he finished and then becoming aware he was washing his hands about 100 times and feeling self-loathing and then writing a sincere application essay about self-loathing and washing hands and soup kitchens. I like that kid. He means well. It’s not like I’m working in a coal mine or whatever so I can’t criticize that kid too much. What’s he supposed to do? Leave college and become homeless just to look more authentic? Screw that. But I don’t want to hang out with that kid and I doubt he wants to hang out with me, and he maybe is a little too self-aware to notice other people’s stories except when listening makes him look like a good listener. And if this story is the Great American Novel that's because people like Franzen create and pay attention to literary magazines and talk about which book is the Great American Novel while the rest of the country does something else. I'm ok with that. I don't believe any book is the Great American Novel and no story can own everyone. <i>Freedom</i> tells one subculture's story well but seems to imply it's telling everyone's story.<br /><br />I get the feeling Franzen has read a lot of endless Russian novels and aspired to write his own. I read the novel quickly and slipped easily into Franzen’s buttery sentences and narrative structure. Near page four hundred I was reading through laced fingers. I felt like I was watching a particularly intellectual movie in which the characters make some really stupid stupid fucking choices. <i>Freedom</i> is complex and well-written but, while the characters’ inner monologues ring truthful, their broad decisions and circumstances often do not. I think Franzen is addressing the “freedom” theme with a focus on how Americans in particular face such a intimidating array of potentialities and the sense that you made the “right” one is almost impossible to attain. On Tuesday you might be in love with your husband but six months later leaving him might feel <i>perfect</i>. Which choice is a sign of truth and which of selfishness? Are you repressing emotions you don’t understand? How well do you know your own motivations? If you stay in a dead marriage are you dooming yourself to decades of regret? What if the marriage isn’t really dead but dormant? What internal perspectives do you control that transcend success and failures? Who can you trust if you don’t know yourself, and how well, really, can you know yourself? These are important questions, and Franzen starts the colloquy well, but these people and storylines function as privileged archetypes except when the plot-architect in Franzen’s consciousness decides to throw a curve here and there because he knows he’s supposed to do so. Franzen is sometimes too meta for his own novels’ good.<br /><br /><i>Freedom</i> also lacks timelessness. In twenty years readers will need endnotes with designations like “Jeff Tweedy: leader of Wilco, an influential country rock band” or “NPR: National Public Radio, an over-the-airwaves audio news station often associated with affluent liberals”. In attempting to catch the spirit of the age Franzen has focused on details that will lack future context. I guess that’s ok. I doubt he’s writing for people 100 years down the road and the details add to the novel’s landscape. This is a book for white people (uh, except Oprah, I guess) with good intentions who listen to NPR, went to college, and kind of hate themselves sometimes. Some of these people, apparently, assign awards and press coverage to literature and a weird cottage industry has emerged around slamming/endorsing Jonathan Franzen’s work. I’m going to leave that conversation to others because I don’t care much one way or the other. You want to argue that one, knock yourself out. I’ll be over here. Franzen mistakes aiming high with these characters, as far as themes are considered, for universiality. And I’m not sure that some of the characters’ wild swerves are more than the author’s personal regrets and fantasies. Listen. I’m going to say that Franzen doesn’t tread this territory as well as, say, Dostoevsky. But remember, then, I’m <i>placing his work in the same sentence as Dostoevsky</i>. I can’t think of many writers alive who can touch his technique. Future generations’ English majors will probably read this novel in a class called “American novels: 2000-2050” and write term papers with titles like “Materialism and Self-Identity in Jonathan Franzen’s <i>Freedom</i>”. They’ll probably get A’s. Franzen, I think, has lived in that literary subculture for a long time, and he’s good at delivering material that exemplifies the best it has to offer. He’s a brilliant technician, and I like brilliant technique, but I’m not sure I loved <i>Freedom</i> as much as I admired it. <i>Freedom</i> is commendable but not great, expansive but nervous in its own expanse. <br /><br />Also, I wish I read something less fucking depressing the week before Christmas. But that’s my fault. I should know better. </span></div></div></div></section></section><section class="ReviewCard__tags"><ul class="CollapsableList"></ul></section><footer class="SocialFooter"><div data-testid="stats"

class="Formatted">*Update 9/23 - Jonathan Franzen was in town doing a reading &amp; signing last night, and after listening to him talk, I’m officially backing off of theory #1 below. He does not seem like a douche bag, at all. In fact, despite all the Oprah hoopla (Which he described as a fiasco, not because of anything that he or Oprah did, but because the whole thing got blown out of proportion.) and the backlash after the early raves for <i>Freedom</i>, Franzen came across as remarkably down-to-earth and funny. He seems like a very smart guy who doesn’t take the media hype too seriously, but is clearly having a lot of fun with all the recent attention.*<br /><br />I picked up Jonathan Franzen’s <i>The Corrections</i> earlier this summer, and it was one of the oddest reading experiences of my life because while I despised nearly every character in it, I still enjoyed the book. So when I started <i>Freedom</i>, I was hoping that I’d find some more likeable people in this one. After fifty pages, I was horrified to realize that it was looking like this book would be another collection of self-absorbed asshats.<br /><br />At that point, I thought there were two possibilities: 1) That Jonathan Franzen is a complete douche bag himself and that he actually thought he was creating sympathetic characters. 2) That Franzen has an even lower opinion of people than I do and uses his skill to convey an utter contempt for mankind by creating these pathetic excuses for human beings. <br /><br />However, as I got deeper into <i>Freedom</i>, and we started getting the history and alternate view points, I started to sympathize with most of the characters. (Except for Joey. I hated that smug little bastard through the entire thing and was really hoping that he‘d get set on fire at some point.)<br /><br />The Berglunds seem like a prime example of family-first socially conscious living. They bought a house in a run down St. Paul neighborhood and became the first wave of gentrification for that area. Walter is a lawyer who works on environmental causes. Patty was a talented college basketball player who channels all her old competitive instincts into being the best mother and neighbor possible. The two kids, Jessica and Joey, are intelligent and seem destined for big things. And just to give them a touch of cool in their suburban existence, Patty and Walter are old friends with Richard Katz, a womanizing musician who has just gained mainstream popularity.<br /><br />But the Berglunds quickly fall apart in spectacular fashion. Joey moves in with a neighbor after rebelling against Patty’s overwhelming love, and he and Walter can’t have a conversation without it turning into a screaming match. Patty has turned into a lost and bitter shadow of her former self. Walter has left his old environmental job to work with a rich man with ties to the coal industry, and as the kids leave for college, the parents are off to D.C. <br /><br />The novel covers a tremendous amount of ground, not just with the elaborate characterizations, but in terms of the backdrops. From Minnesota to New York to DC to West Virginia to South America, Franzen touches on 9/11, the Iraq war, environmentalism, overpopulation, rampant consumerism and the political fracturing of America, but by keeping it in terms of a family disintegration, he keeps the story relatable.<br /> <br />One of the key things that comes up repeatedly is the idea that Americans have about freedom. It’s a word tossed around easily, and as Franzen explores here, many take it as their God given right to engage in mass consumption and lead completely unexamined lives with no regard for the consequences. Those who ask for more social responsibility are derided as ‘liberals’ and ‘intellectuals’ and ’elitists’. (I’m pretty sure Sarah Palin would hate this book. Assuming she could find someone to read it to her and explain the big words.) <br /><br />But this isn’t about idealizing liberal policies. Franzen makes a lot of valid points about how American politics has become a constant screaming match more concerned with beating the other guy than accomplishing anything. He makes good use of the character of Walter to illustrate how all the pent up rage and frustration, even for a ‘good’ cause, can make for a pretty miserable life. What good is trying to save the world if you can’t stand any of the people in it?<br /><br />Terrific book that’s almost a pitch perfect statement about what American life has been like since 2000 as seen through the eyes of some flawed, but decent people. (Except for Joey. That kid is a prick.) While freedom and happiness are usually considered to go hand-in-hand, these characters show that poorly used freedom can make you supremely unhappy.<br /><br />Random thoughts:<br /><br />-There’s several similarities to <i>The Corrections</i>: Everyone hates their family. There’s a very odd love triangle. A mother/son relationship is pushed to creepy extremes to irritate a father. A character gets caught up in an elaborate overseas get-rich-quick scheme. The daughter of the family is probably the most adult and sensible character. And there’s a really nasty scene involving human turds. Eww. What’s with all the poop, Franzen?<br /><br />- One of my favorite parts was Richard Katz’s interview where he makes several hilarious comments about the music industry.<br /> <br />-<i>The personality susceptible to the dream of limitless freedom is a personality, also prone, should the dream ever sour, to misanthropy and rage.</i> That’s just about my entire existence summed up in one sentence.<br /><br />- There’s a plot point involving cats attacking song birds late in the book. Just as I was reading this section, a stray cat came up on our deck and tried to attack one of our two house kitties through the door screen. It was very startling to be reading about feral cats and then hear godawful yowling, hissing, screeching and general mayhem in the next room.

class="ReviewText"><section class="ReviewText__content"><div class="TruncatedText"><div class="TruncatedText__text TruncatedText__text--5" data-testid="contentContainer"><div><span class="Formatted">Here's the thing about this book: I was really expecting to enjoy it. I say that for two reasons. The first is The Corrections. Not the book itself, which is still quietly residing on my shelf, waiting for its day in the sun… Nay, I speak of the buzz. You see, I know people. And a lot of those people read things. And some of those things were their own copies of The Corrections. And the buzz was, as far as I could tell, that the people that I know liked The Corrections. In fact, their only complaint seemed to be that there were no likeable characters in the book, that they all seemed petty and kind of horrible. But,… (and here's the twist),… that actually sounded like a selling point to me. Because, I'm actually a little petty myself, I'm prone to dabble in misanthropy and, besides, who doesn't love a good antihero? <br /><br />The second reason that I was ready to love Freedom is that I have read a touch of Franzen in my day. Not much, mind you. But I found How To Be Alone an incredibly well-crafted and insightful read. I was struck by the way the collection dealt reasonably with the complicated position of literarily minded folk in a digital age. I was so taken with How To Be Alone, in fact, that I thought there was simply no way that Freedom could be bad. Even if it wasn't overflowing with goodness, it certainly wouldn't be unpleasant. In short, my formal adoration of Freedom was simply a forgone conclusion, an eventuality waiting to transpire.<br /><br />Oh, me.<br /><br />Let me break off a little truth for you. I hated reading this book. The thing that's frustrating about it is that there is no one quality that makes it bad. The characters are unlikeable, but not in a devil-may-care, what-will-they-do-next kind of way. The characters are odious because they are self-absorbed and petty… but more than that, they're insufferably boring. It's not that they don't wander around hurting each other; it's that their sins are largely those of inaction or inertia; that they sit around and complain to themselves and moan on about their disappointments, and you find yourself relieved when they actually take action of some kind, no matter what it is, simply because it means something is happening in the book, that you are reading a novel wherein events happen that have significance. And you quickly find that you not only start to wish the characters thorough unhappiness, but further, you actually long for some kind horrible nuclear disaster to clear the slate so that Franzen can just start over with an entirely new cast midway through the novel.<br /><br />The truth is that I tried really, really hard to hold out hope for the novel. The point of no return for me was right around when the author intimates that everyone secretly enjoys the smell of their own flatulence. [Cue my head slamming into the table I was reading at.] In all honesty, I didn't just dislike the book. I came to resent the very existence of the world in which the characters existed. It made me wish the Genesis had never happened, that God had refrained from rendering form out of the formless at all. I would rather read Jonathon Franzen's descriptions of the void than another wretched moment in the lives of these abysmal characters.<br /></span></div></div></div></section></section><section

class="ReviewText"><section class="ReviewText__content"><div class="TruncatedText"><div class="TruncatedText__text TruncatedText__text--5" data-testid="contentContainer"><div><span class="Formatted">Okay, so earlier this summer I was waiting to see The National play Prospect Park (<i>"Of course you were, Jessica....</i>" -- but bear with me, that's my point), and I sent a text message to the guy who'd given me the tickets, thanking him again and observing that "White People don't LIKE seeing The National play Prospect Park; White People LOVE seeing The National play Prospect Park." This was a reference, of course, to the oft-quoted blog that holds a very high place on the seemingly endless list it identified, of Stuff White People Like. Now, I've always felt a bit annoyed and repelled by the lazy shorthand of race there, then ashamed when I use it myself -- since really the demographic group in question is, like the crowd at the bandshell, not exclusively white, and since there are millions of white people whom it does not describe -- but the concept's too pricelessly apt to resist frequent citing.<br /><br />The brilliance of Stuff White People Like is in its identification of a socioeconomic group which is, yes, largely white, but more to the point Obama-voting, liberal arts degree-holding, farmers market-shopping, NPR-listening, irony-appreciating, <i>New Yorker</i>-subscribing, boutique cable show-watching, indie-rock-listening, Clash tee-shirt-wearing baby-rearing, freelance-or-nonprofit-job-working, and neighborhood-gentrifying, but also profoundly self-loathing in a weird and specific way that is a bit hard either to detach from or reconcile with its incredible self-absorption and uncomfortable, only partly ironic smugness and conviction that the stuff it likes is <i>good</i>.<br /><br />Jonathan Franzen should be on the list of Stuff White People Like, but he should also be on the (perhaps equivalent) list of Stuff White People Don't Want To Like But Do, which reflects the ambivalent discomfort of this particular group. We don't want to like Franzen, because we're supposed to, and that contrarian streak is built into our bones. And to add to all that, Franzen writes about -- and nails -- our very essence. I can't think of another book that so perfectly sums up and explores the attributes and complexities of this particular set.<br /><br />Okay, enough with all this generalization: did this white person like <i>Freedom</i>? Well okay, the first 190 pages was the most fun I've had in years. And I did really like <i>Freedom</i>, and wish I could give it three-point-five stars. My criterion for the fourth star is that I itch to read it, and I itched like crazy while reading it. Yeah, this book was <i>good.</i><br /><br />A confession: my behavior while traveling in public, and especially on mass transit, can best be described as sociopathic. If you live in this city -- and perhaps even more likely if you don't, but have visited -- there's a fair chance I've harmed you physically while I ran for the train. Sorry, but you probably don't walk fast enough, and I was trying to get to the platform. The TRAIN might be coming, and I GOT to be on it!!! Understand that I am in a great hurry to arrive in short order wherever I'm going, which is somewhat inexplicable since once I'm there I don't have much to do, and will probably just sit there, dicking around on the Internet; but while I'm en route, I'm a terror, and slow old ladies be damned! I'll hit them with my umbrella! I'll give them all flat tires! But while reading <i>Freedom</i> the number of citywide subway station stair assaults must have dropped; I was in no particular hurry to get where I was headed, and often took the local train or waited for the next less-crowded car. I took crosstown buses where normally I motor on foot, and rode elevators instead of my usual mad running up the stairs. Over the past week, I honestly looked forward to my commute, and to deadtime at work waiting in a courtroom, because these moments gave me another opportunity to read. This is one of two of the most important tests of a book: it was so entertaining and so fabulously engaging that I wanted to pick it up at actually all times.<br /><br />The other test, though, <i>Freedom</i> didn't really pass. I did vastly enjoy a lot of this book, but it didn't give me the more rare and elusive experience that's the other main thing that I want when I'm reading. I didn't ultimately feel moved, not emotionally or ontologically. I didn't see the world, or my life, in an earthshaking new way (I did start wondering briefly about how my parents might've fucked me up, but not in a fruitful way, so I don't think that counts). And while I did definitely like it, and got involved with the characters, by the end I felt disappointed, and also pretty bored.<br /><br />Sorry, this is already pretty long and not much of a review. Let's see, <i>Freedom</i> is a novel about a family, the Berglunds, and if you want to read a good review of it, I defer to Mike Reynolds. I myself was instantly hooked from the beginning chapter, which is a description of the family from the perspective of the community where they live, and I loved -- <i>loved</i> -- the next portion, an "autobiography" (wonderfully titled "Mistakes Were Made") by the wife, Patty Berglund, which takes us up to page 187. But I'm afraid that for me, things did peak there, and I'm a bit baffled by all the buzz about "greatest living American writer" and "genius." I did like this book. But it wasn't <i>that</i> great.<br /><br />So but like, I really don't follow these things, but full disclosure, I couldn't free myself while reading from thoughts about the Author, and I really don't think that this was just me. Other reviews on this site have noted that the characters are all a lot the same, but I don't really see that as a problem, and that's kind of what I liked about it. For me, the only character that never really came off was daughter Jessica, which I maybe took too personally, as that is my name (I did like the part where Jessica agonizes over the impossibility of finding a decent New York guy to go out with, though I liked it more in the abstract, and wanted its execution to be more amazing). I felt a bit shortchanged when it came to the son's relationship with his lady; there were all the seeds to be sown, and then we just stopped hearing about them. But my point partly, with the Franzenness, was that the two parents did feel very real, maybe the more so for seeming like two only slightly varying manifestations of the same certain guy.<br /><br />Here's my beef about Jonathan Franzen, and I know I should do some more google research before I start on with this, but I'm feeling kind of lazy, and I doubt anyone's still reading this.... See, I associate him, like a lot of people, with that Oprah thing in the nineties, when he withdrew from being in the Oprah bookclub, got lots of shit, and as a result (maybe) became wildly popular. Franzen's Wikipedia article has a quotation from him at that time, in which he explains that he didn't want people thinking <i>The Corrections</i> was a women's book (by "people" I mean men, of course) and therefore not reading it. Now again, I'm only dimly aware of what's been going on recently, but I've heard lady authors are bitching (like we do) about all the press and blowjobs Franzen's been getting, and suggesting that this is really all because of that Y-chromosome he has. And honestly, I was distracted while reading this by my conviction that it's true.<br /><br />I don't want to plagiarize, though I can't remember who said it, but some upset woman I read at some point was complaining about the "chick lit" ghetto and said that Franzen writes what are essentially domestic novels, and that if he weren't a man they'd be considered women's fiction. And that, friend, is <i>true.</i> It is painfully true. Especially the better, earlier, female-perspectived portion of this novel is all about relationships and a marriage and family, and all those lady things. And if Jonathan were Jessica Franzen, at least half the readers he has (except Mike Reynolds, boy wonder, who actually reads stuff by chicks!) would never have touched it and it would've had some dumb pinky cover, but because he's a man, it's a Serious Novel. Yeah, actually I do really think that. Without all the male masturbation and the obviously male author, this could've so easily been written off as chick lit. And it makes me -- perhaps unjustly -- hate Jonathan Franzen to think that he might not recognize that. It might not seem this way, but I'm not one of those people who carries on endlessly about WhiteMalePrivilege, but I actually do want to with him. Because he gets the kind of attention that similarly talented women wouldn't get, while writing about topics that aren't considered Serious when women write about them.<br /><br />Okay, I'm sorry, I'm rambling again (really bad day at work, srsly, sorry). This book, hm, well what more can I say? Franzen is a terrific writer, and I loved the addictive easiness of his prose style, which can unfortunately come back and bite an author because it makes any glitch seem egregious. I hated the partial sentences that seemed to creep in more as the novel progressed, though I might not have noticed them if his writing weren't otherwise so perfect. He writes sentences as readable as the most digestible best-seller, but good. The problem is that being that good makes people angrier if you let them down. (Especially if those people are me, and apply ridiculously high standards to anything they have great hopes for, while giving tons of social work sympathy to the obvious losers. You guys should hope that I never have children! I'll criticize and neglect the good kid, while coddling the fuck-up.)<br /><br />Okay, I did feel let down by this book; again, I really liked it. But by the end I felt bored by the characters, especially by depression (which is deadly boring; note my biases, as a reader who was unable to make it all the way through David Foster Wallace's short story "The Depressed Person" despite thinking it brilliant), and I really thought the plot and characters ran off the road at later points into melodrama. At a certain early juncture I felt sure our Berglunds' marriage would survive, though I wasn't sure I cared that it did, or what that had to do with me.<br /><br />But don't get me wrong! This was a very fine novel. Frazen's ability to create characters is wonderful, and the whole thing's pretty zeitgeisty, which is nice in this dying form. No, sorry Jonathan: it's not <i>War and Peace</i>. But in its mostly successful efforts to link the narcissistic and eerily familiar concerns of individuals to the larger events and forces of our time, it is a lot closer than anything recent I can think of.<br /><br />Best of all, now I have something to fall back on, the next time I'm at a Brooklyn party and the White People are all talking about <i>True Blood</i>. "Haven't seen it," I'll admit, as I swig a microbrew. "But have you read <i>Freedom</i>?"<br /><br />And we'll take it from there.</span></div></div></div></section></section><section class="ReviewCard__tags"><ul class="CollapsableList"><a

class="ReviewText"><section class="ReviewText__content"><div class="TruncatedText"><div class="TruncatedText__text TruncatedText__text--5" data-testid="contentContainer"><div><span class="Formatted">This book hoovers you into its world from the first page and before you know what's what you've missed your bus stop and you are <i>into it</i>. But there are problems. Yes. I will tell you about some of them. You would expect no less of me.<br /><br />I was reading along with the main character Patty Berglund’s autobiographical statement “Mistakes Were Made” (p 27 – 187) and was lapping it up until soap bubbles began appearing between me and the page. The bubbles became suds – undeniable suds. I could not divest myself of the realisation that things were getting soapier by the minute – no, I said, to any passing stranger who I could get to take an interest in the current state of literature, this is Jonathan Franzen messing with our heads, taunting us with the cardboardy and the cutouty. This is not to be taken completely seriously. E.g., hoving into view, with his axe in his hand, comes a character called Richard Katz, indie rock god, Mr Moody Bohemia and all purpose babe magnet.<br /><br /><br />Richard Kats<br />Wears cool hats<br />Has eyes for Patty<br />(Whose friend is batty)<br />His room-mate Walter<br />Will never fault her<br />Her heart may wander<br />But his gets fonder<br />Long and lean is<br />Richard’s penis<br />Walter’s trusting<br />But Patty’s lusting<br />Wait - is this Franzen<br />Or marzipanzen?<br /><br />As Mr Katz’s pecker rose, so did my heart sink, for he is indeed a creature from Romanceland (that place of untrammelled pecs and mesmerising vaginas). His sultry pouting unshaven lips launch a thousand bustling teenage hips and one glance from his stubbly unshaven pouting guitar causes the female heart to bound about like an escaping baboon, and indeed such is his popularity that he can hardly write his tuneful songs of ten minute angst for having to shoo flocks of sweet 18 year olds gently away from his private parts. <br /> This character is played straight. We are to take this character seriously and we are not to laugh. I gradually became aware of this as the character Richard Katz did not go away.<br /> And oh my goodness gracious me, there is some horrible writing that bubbles up whenever he is centre stage. Richard is – yes, you get the picture! - the cool but morally bankrupt friend of Walter, the entirely uncool but totally bicycling and planet-befriending morally good guy. Here’s Richard meditating on his friendship with Walter :<br /><br /><i>No other man had warmed Katz’s loins the way the sight of Walter did after long absence. These groinal heatings were no more about literal sex, no more homo, than the hard-ons he got from a long-anticipated first snort of blow.</i><br /><br />Ewww! <br /><br />Richard Katz describing a woman :<br /><br /><i>A solid B-plus that could be an A-minus if she would work for extra credit.</i><br /><br />Again : Ewww! By page 200 I was thinking that I’d be having more fun watching Desperate Housewives because the dialogue is wittier. It got so I was playing the game of spotting titles of old songs amidst the soap. I got “I only want to be with you” (Dusty Springfield, page 235), and “What are you going to do when I’m gone?” (Barbara Lewis, p 452). <br /><br />Okay, what's good about Freedom? Ha ha, what an ironical question. This book gets most of its points for trying really really hard. For vein-throbbing brain-melding attempts to encompass the economics of Iraqi reconstruction contracts, mountaintop removal mining, songbird conservation and sundry other realities of the world's most modern country, and embed all of this into sketches of how two or three complicated families live from day to day and year to year, to pull all this together – well actually, a lot of the time it’s like JF is flailing away at his material, not the assured mover of chess pieces on the board but the frantically photographing &amp; camcording and ambulance-chasing kind of novelist who rushes around after his many characters &amp; can’t quite keep up with them all. That part of the whole thing I liked. But oh – phrases like<br /><br /><i>His thing with Connie was too intense and strange – too sincere, too muddled with love- to be fungible as coin of bragging.</i><br /><br />and<br /><br /><i>Connie had a wry compact intelligence, a firm little clitoris of discernment and sensitivity</i><br /><br />and<br /><br /><i>Katz’s blood was up, he was all jittery-jangly. It was like coke cut heavily with nasty meth.</i> (Is this a simile JF thinks will ring bells with his readers? No, so it’s something his character the egregious Katz would think. But then how does this translate its meaning to the non coke-cut-heavily-with-nasty-meth-hoovering reader? It translates as : <i>It was really quite unpleasant or I assume so. </i>Maybe if the meth was nice he’d be just jangly and not jittery too. Oh I don’t know. )<br /><br />Anyway - pretty ghastly. And - oh well, while I’m moaning and griping, here’s some more. On occasion Franzen goes into page long riffs on such things as road rage or the stupid things that teenagers do - these are exactly like riffs in a stand up comedian's routine. They’re quite fun in a sneery sort of way but they do seem like JF is getting a bit of humour in there in case he gets accused of having written another Big Depressing Hell In A Handbasket Novel, which really, this is (Iraq, global warning, environmental destruction, overpopulation, oh oh oh woe is us woe is us, smite us Lord, we fully deserve every last smite).<br /><br />And : now obviously JF does not wish to do this, but every time one of his young characters (say Jessica) berates one of his slightly less young characters (say Lalitha) for being out of touch with they way young people do right now (e.g not knowing that kids have mostly abandoned emailing for texting) he, JF, is perforce, as author, advertising just how down with the kids he himself is, which, alas and alack, is kind of like seeing your 52 year old uncle do the Twist. No, the Frug. No, I mean that Body Pop thing. <br /><br />And - this book is built out of sturdy slabs of knowingness and social nuance. You have to get what’s intended by the great many phrases like “in the earliest years when you could drive a Volvo 240 without feeling self-conscious”. Well, maybe some of us can’t quite be bothered to rack our brains to think what a Volvo 240 is and why it became something you would be ashamed of. (JF : Well, do your homework then. I want active engaged readers. PB : Yeah, I know, sorry and all. But I did finish your damned big book. So, you know, be quiet.)<br /><br />JF in a Freedom-promoting interview said that the most important thing he should be doing in his novels is<br /><br />‘To find an adequate narrative vehicle for the most difficult stuff at the core of me, in the hope that that might resonate with the reader who otherwise has been feeling alone with those deep, difficult feelings.’<br /><br />Well, he tried, he really tried, and for a great number of star-besprinkling reviewers, he succeeded. It’s good, it is … er… good, long but good, long long long but quite good. <br /><br /></span></div></div></div></section></section><section class="ReviewCard__tags"><ul class="CollapsableList"><a

your convenience in list form)</i> <br /><br />Before you think I'm mean, please note that "freedom is terrible" is kind of the point of Franzen's book: Freedom doesn't get you what you want. Uninhibited, it brings a whole slew of problems along with it and, assuming you're not a slave or living in North Korea, the fact that your life is miserable is not due to a lack of freedom. <br /><br />Ironically, you can also substitute the <i>book</i> Freedom for the <i>word</i> freedom above, and it doesn't change the meaning of anything, which is kind of unintentionally funny on Franzen's part. And thus, we come to my review.<br /><br />My Reasons for Hating This Book:<br /><br /><b>A)</b> Every single person in this book is an asshole, a narcissist, or both, and after being around them for 500+ slow-going pages, I now hate humankind. It's no big secret that Franzen isn't particularly fond of humanity, but if he doesn't care about his characters, why should I?<br /><br /><b>B)</b> Unnecessary storylines and characters. Cutting out Jenna and her DB Goldman boyfriend Nick, Eliza the Sociopath, and Lalitha and the Free Space population-control mission alone would have saved me from 200 pages of non-integral reading. {NB: I understand why Franzen created these characters and found them necessary, but if the pages of your book turn like they're covered in molasses, you don't really want the unabridged version.}<br /><br /><b>C)</b> The whole thing felt directionless. Books don't need to end tied up in a pretty bow, but I would still like to believe that authors sit down to write a book because they have a story to tell. Otherwise, beginnings, ends, middles--they're all arbitrary. Even Tolstoy had a larger plan, but I'm not convinced Franzen did.<br /><br /><b>D)</b> The whole thing reeked of <i>American Beauty</i>-esque disenfranchised yuppie-ism. Your problems are not that interesting, important or unique. <br /><br />As such, I contend that <i>Freedom</i> is terrible. </span></div></div></div></section></section><section

class="ReviewText"><section class="ReviewText__content"><div class="TruncatedText"><div class="TruncatedText__text TruncatedText__text--5" data-testid="contentContainer"><div><span class="Formatted">After reading <i>Wuthering Heights</i>, I had this idea: I should make a bookshelf called "Assholes and Asshats," a little place that could serve as a warning to people who immediately disregard books containing characters they have trouble relating to and sympathizing with. You know, jerks, dickwads, the stoney cold and self-involved, the pompously mean and rich or bitterly poor and junk-addled characters loitering about within the pages of many harder-to-swallow books. Personally, I have both experienced a lot of shittiness in life <i>and</i> inflicted it on others, so I find it important and enlightening to read about just how much people (of which I am one) can and often do royally suck to and about one another. I don't need a likable lead in order to power through a book, and I in fact very often desire just the opposite. There can be a richness to such characters, an honesty which is frequently lacking in Hero-like characters and/or the tragically trampled upon, naively and purely good souls featured in more soul-massaging, hopeful literature. And <i>Freedom</i> is (mostly) not a nice tale. It is, rather, almost 600 pages about assholes and asshats being assholes and asshats to each other to varying degrees over a long period of time. It is not a tale for happy housewives, no matter what Oprah Winfrey said about it.<br /><br /><i>Freedom</i> teeters for me: I offer it a respectful four stars, but as I distance myself from it, I can already see it wobbling near the edge about to drop back into the 3-star realm. Don't get me wrong: I enjoyed the book. It is not sloggy at all; the little time it takes to breeze through this thing seems almost unfair to the actual physical bulk of the text. I never found myself bored or bogged down, and I felt invested in the outcome of the story to the very last page. I think a lot of what helped keep up the pace was the fact that the story was told from the viewpoint of several different narrators, all interconnected, providing shifts in style and perspective which made for a more rounded out experience of the events, and a deeper understanding of the individual players in this drama (their motives, needs, baggage, etc). However, even with the inside scoop, something kept bothering me about these particular assholes/hats. They seemed almost...too familiar? Flat in a lot of ways, despite the time and effort put into rounding them out? I know a lot of people may disagree with me about this, but hear me out if you would be so kind. Here is a brief description of each of the main characters:<br /><br />Walter: <i>The Guy You Are Supposed To Pity</i>. Sweet, ideological, overachieving, good friend, good husband, good citizen, liberal, book-smart, giving, loving, naive, nature-preserving Walter...you know, the rug for the more venomous characters' feet, the guy who never does wrong by anybody, and so spends his life being sucked dry by Shitty Friend Generic Rock Star Studs and She-Beasts. <br /><br />Patty: <i>The She-Beast</i>. Selfish, underachieving, shitty wife, shitty mother, vortex of negativity and self-pity, wine-sluggin', two-timin', emotional breakdown-havin', bi-polar Patty. She is the thorn in many a side, and is presumably only happy when playing basketball, interacting with her Mirror Image With a Penis of a son, booze-binging till a purge, or engaging in torrid sexual encounters with some Shitty Friend Generic Rock Star Stud.<br /><br />Richard: <i>The Shitty Friend Generic Rock Star Stud</i>: Oh, this one's my favorite. Here's a guy in a band who likes to sleep with his much younger fans (surprise!) and best friend's crushes and girlfriends (oh no!), has off and on substance abuse problems (whaaaat?), doesn't really know himself until it is too late (you're kidding me) and is a ramblin' man who can never really give a part of his heart to anyone or be meaningful at all in anyone's life but his own because gifted musicians are apparently wholly incapable of multi-tasking on any level whatsoever. (Aside from, of course, the sex-aaaay seXXX level, since all musicians are spectacular in bed...spectacular and <i>rough</i>! Didn't you know that?) There is a bit of depth hidden within Richard's brotherly love for Walter and distant longing for Walter and Patty's "normal life," but even these somewhat numb feelings are...let's say "misplaced." I'll stop here with Richard, since if I say anything more, there will only be a few crumbles of substance left for the novel to reveal. Simply put, you have for the most part heard it all before in any random teen movie. <br /><br />Child Unit 1: <i>Patty With A Penis</i> (aka Joey): All the traits of Patty, only politically conservative, money hungry, and penis-having.<br /><br />Child Unit 2: <i>Walter With A Vag</i> (aka Jessica): Most of the traits of Walter, with far, far less character development than basically anyone else in the book. She is about as important to this story and the family within it, as prized, as a 2nd or 3rd born girl-child in China.<br /><br />Connie: <i>The Inspirational Doormat</i>: The neighbor girl. She teaches young women that if you blindly love someone, tailor all your life decisions around him and his whims, deal with him ignoring you for months at a time, cheating on you repeatedly, and generally treating you like shit, and then you apologize profusely for bothering him by mentioning any of it, things may work out for you after all. If you really start feeling isolated and pathetic, just sleep around and then call him to tell him all about it: that'll get him knockin' at your window again. Work it, girl!<br /><br />I have typed a lot of words here, but I have mostly focused on what pissed me off and ignored what I appreciated about this novel. There are other characters of notable importance that I have failed to mention, and there is generally more to the ones that I have brought up. However, the basic shells still stand, and they feel redundant. You have seen this film a dozen times, you know how the drama plays out, and yet Franzen is rich with the gifts of both believable dialogue and perfect pacing, so he somehow manages to pull it all together into an engaging story. You feel for most of the characters, no matter how much you may dislike them. I guess the other thing about the novel that really got to me was this twist on the above characters: rather than simply standing as unawares examples of common character motifs, these people were all terribly hyper-aware of themselves. Unlike most storybook characters who see their own motivations as pure and good, yet come to find themselves shocked by their own bad behavior, Franzen's characters fully dissect and execute their plans of being horrible to one another in advance, and come to find themselves instead shocked by their inherent goodness. They seem <i>surprised</i> that they even give a shit about each other and the world around them. I know people often trick and misread themselves leading to much mistake-making, but do people actually analyze themselves as much as Franzen's characters do and consider the awful shit they pull so thoroughly beforehand only to find in the end that they didn't really know anything about themselves and actually just really, really lurrrrrve each other? <i>Really</i>? <br /><br />Sorry to complain so much. Again, I did enjoy this book. You probably will, too. Just be forewarned that there are a lot of predictably soapy scenes coming from a lot of predictably soapy characters, they are often mean as shit to one another, and their heads are for the most part buried deeply within their behinds: assholes and asshats. <br /><br />Oh, one more thing: I waited so long to read this guy because I mixed him up with the Jon F who wrote <i>Everything is Illuminated</i>, and (for no good reason aside from a vague annoyance with that movie) simply the idea of that book and its author got on my nerves. I was wrong, so I gave this novel a shot. I'll probably read another Franzen.<br /><br />*Upon reflection, this is getting downgraded to a 3. I'm too nice with these stars...so I'm putting my foot down, dammit! </span></div></div></div></section></section><section class="ReviewCard__tags"><ul class="CollapsableList"><a

class="Formatted">Take two parts Tom Wolfe, one part Charles Dickens, stir in generous portions of current events and humor, breath over it tragedy like pouring vermouth on a very dry martini, bake in a pan of realistic humanism and you have this wonderful book called Freedom. <br><br>We get to know four generations of Berglands, from the comfortable but restraining farms of Sweden to the comfortable but restraining backwoods of Minnesota. We get to learn family dynamics and are privy to relationships that work and many that do not. We also get to know the Emersons, the Paulsons, the Moynahans and a very archetypal musician who is at once repelled by his personified stereotype and powerless to do anything but wallow in his own self centeredness. <br><br>We also get to know dozens of other characters who are as realistic portraits of true life as if they were shaken dry Polaroids. Franzen’s true gift is his characterizations, which are spot on, multi-layered and rich in detail. The story is compelling, entrancing, funny, heartbreaking and thought provoking. <br><br>In Freedom, Franzen has painted a picture of our time, who we are now and how we got here. But fundamentally, it is also an illustration of hope. Because as a family is a microcosm of a society, we are very messed up, but also OK deep down; and no matter how bad it gets, Franzen offers an always accessible option of hope and reconciliation, if only we choose it.<br><br><img src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1554293842i/27309203._SX540_.jpg" width="400" height="160" alt="description"

class="ReviewText"><section class="ReviewText__content"><div class="TruncatedText"><div class="TruncatedText__text TruncatedText__text--5" data-testid="contentContainer"><div><span class="Formatted">UPDATED.<br /><br />To keep in style of the book this review will be just a lot of rambling. <br /><br />I mean, it was mostly a soap opera. And I just don’t do soap operas. I can just about manage about 10 minutes every 5th episode, but that’s about it. And Franzen submitted me to 570 bloody pages of a soap opera which I had to digest in a few sittings. <br />Like in all soap operas, everything ends well and love conquers all, of course some characters might have to be killed off along the way, but it seems like a small price to pay for a happy ending, non?<br /><br />If it was well written, then maybe. But how can I take this sort of thing seriously:<br /><br />"Patty said no, Walter insisted, she insisted no, he insisted yes. Then she realized he didn’t have a car and was offering to ride the bus with her, and she insisted no all over again, and he insisted yes"<br /><br />Sorry, what is this? Is this the Great American Novel? Are you kidding me?<br /><br />"She almost suggested to Walter that he had better kiss her first, if he was going to be asking her to live with him, but she was so offended that she didn’t feel like being kissed at that moment."<br /><br />And if you are tired of this sugary girly revelations, you can get the more raw stuff when the perspective changes to Katz:<br /><br />"His dick was saying yes to something now, and this something was certainly not the wideish ass of the retreating jogger. Had death, in fact, been his dick’s message in sending him to Washington? Had he simply misunderstood its prophecy?"<br /><br />You get the idea.<br /><br />And don’t even get me started on the fucked up chronology. It wasn’t done in eloquent, mysterious way, it was done in a blabbermouth with ADHD way. It is like my friend Maciek, who tells me a story and in the middle of it he remembers some other story that might or might not be related to the story he is telling me so he tells me that other story, and then some other story that somehow came from the second story, and then maybe he will return to the main story and you end up wondering if the second story actually happened in the middle of the first story or it was just his way of telling a story.<br /><br />The final moral from this book is that we are all fucked up in our own special way but it will all be alright unless, of course, we become Republicans, in which case there will be no redemption. <br /><br />It almost killed me. This book almost killed me. But as they say what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger, therefore this book made stronger, so for that alone I had to give it two stars. <br /><br />I will admit that Patty and Walter were both interesting characters with all the supporting cast being all sorts of caricatures and serving as props to the main duo.<br /><br />Now, I am off to read a book about people who do things and have real problems.<br /><br />*UPDATE - oh yeah. And I also forgot to say that if this book was written by a woman, it would be deemed chick lit and stuck in a pastel colour cover with birds and flowers. No one would even look at it twice because there is so much better chick lit out there. But as Jonathan Franzen is lucky enough to be a man, this, all of a sudden, is the Great American Novel. DON'T MAKE ME LAUGH.<br />If anyone else claims there is no sexism in literary/publishing world, this here is my best demonstrative evidence that there is. Honest to God, who would take this book seriously if it was written by a woman and had something pink on the cover?<br /></span></div></div></div></section></section><section

class="ReviewText__content"><div class="TruncatedText"><div class="TruncatedText__text TruncatedText__text--5" data-testid="contentContainer"><div><span class="Formatted">Times I hear, “You either love him or hate him,” I often both love him <i>and</i> hate him. In feeling lukewarm, there’s a distinction to be made in how you got there. To find every aspect average is not the same as combining extreme likes and dislikes that tally to the same net amount. I’d rather feel strongly both ways. So here’s my highly variable assessment of Franzen and his latest.<br /><br />On the “like” side of the ledger, I have to give him his due for being one helluva good writer. His sentences flow, his words are well-chosen, and his observations (of which there are many) are made in an interesting way. I also liked how he alternated among his four point-of-view characters. He doesn’t half-ass it in developing them either. I noticed, too, more redeeming qualities in these people compared to the dyspeptic family in his previous would-be classic, <i>The Corrections</i>. At least for a while that’s what I thought. <br /><br />But Franzen’s tendency towards acrimony eventually plays out. Everyone has problems, nobody’s happy for long, and they lash out fiercely, often indiscriminately. In a way it was more depressing this time because for some characters, over some stretches, he actually made me care. I can handle “dark”, and sometimes even “bleak”, but for Franzen’s cast, they didn’t seem to come by it honestly. Walter and Patty, the married couple, were every bit as inconstant (and not just towards each other) as they were intelligent (or at least meant to be). Their inconsistencies didn’t ring true. <br /><br />If you’re in the “love him” camp, you might view this as a wonderful saga of our times. The modern day, green-conscious, gentrifying class (I believe “yuppie” is the antiquated term) is skillfully deconstructed. Generations are studied. Evolution is noted. And it is a big, sweeping book with a big, obvious theme (see title). Detractors, though, may have a point when they mention how confused the politics can seem. Son Joey might as well have worked for Halliburton, but that’s at odds with his previously avowed views and certainly with his upbringing. Walter is a conservationist, but becomes a sorely compromised one. And Patty’s family back east is from the limousine liberal school of thought, yet had a very unsupportive view when it came to a vital women’s issue (I won’t say what, but it rhymes with date crepe). You might conclude they were all a little naïve about the best and worst traits of their own chosen sides.<br /><br />The big theme was mentioned often and explicitly. The conclusion is easy to summarize: Freedom isn’t always a good thing. You can be given enough rope to hang yourself. This is true for individuals as well as societies, and his examples, either personal or political, were meant to show this. To be honest, I don’t see Franzen at his insightful best when it comes to this issue. Who wouldn’t agree that freedom is good <i>up to the point it encroaches on toes</i>? The crux of the biscuit comes in deciding where the line should be drawn. I also felt that the characters hurt by their own freedom of choice were pretty short-sighted, even borderline stupid at times. Fortunately, some were capable of learning from their mistakes. Discovering who comes around to a new way of thinking is one of the pleasures of the book because most of them needed to.<br /><br />I suspect the most telling critiques recognize what the literary establishment says is at stake. Is this truly an American classic? By those standards, I side with the arbiters of such things who look at the pillars of our American experience – individualism, consumerism, might as a proxy for right, and self-interest (which may teeter with self- loathing) – and distrust Franzen’s constructs to represent their abuses. I recognize buttheads in everyday life, including my own brand, but I just don’t see <i>his</i> type as being the real deal. <br /><br />It occurs to me that my review may be as inconsistent as one of Franzen’s flawed characters. I’m saying I don’t much care for the core of what he says, but that he says it very well. That gets him three and a half equivocating stars, rounded to four – well short of Great American Novel status, but worth the effort to see what all the fuss is about.<br

read \u003ci\u003eFreedom\u003c/i\u003e the week before Christmas. What was I thinking? Did I want a bleak, almost sullen, portrayal of America in the new century? And not a complete one, either, but limited to privileged white people? Why didn’t I just sit on the couch, get drunk, and watch \u003ci\u003eSalt\u003c/i\u003e and \u003ci\u003eEasy A\u003c/i\u003e? Ok, I did that, too, but my kids were off of school and apparently believe they should get to watch television as well, so I went upstairs and read away a few afternoons. Stupid \u003ci\u003eFreedom\u003c/i\u003e. Mr. Franzen, you’re good. Most writers couldn’t touch your talent. However, I think I’d rather read something less technically adept but also less dismal and self-involved. If \u003ci\u003eFreedom\u003c/i\u003e were a teenager the novel would be that really smart and well-intentioned affluent kid worried about impressing Harvard in his application and doing community service at a soup kitchen but washing his hands about 100 times when he finished and then becoming aware he was washing his hands about 100 times and feeling self-loathing and then writing a sincere application essay about self-loathing and washing hands and soup kitchens. I like that kid. He means well. It’s not like I’m working in a coal mine or whatever so I can’t criticize that kid too much. What’s he supposed to do? Leave college and become homeless just to look more authentic? Screw that. But I don’t want to hang out with that kid and I doubt he wants to hang out with me, and he maybe is a little too self-aware to notice other people’s stories except when listening makes him look like a good listener. And if this story is the Great American Novel that's because people like Franzen create and pay attention to literary magazines and talk about which book is the Great American Novel while the rest of the country does something else. I'm ok with that. I don't believe any book is the Great American Novel and no story can own everyone. \u003ci\u003eFreedom\u003c/i\u003e tells one subculture's story well but seems to imply it's telling everyone's story.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eI get the feeling Franzen has read a lot of endless Russian novels and aspired to write his own. I read the novel quickly and slipped easily into Franzen’s buttery sentences and narrative structure. Near page four hundred I was reading through laced fingers. I felt like I was watching a particularly intellectual movie in which the characters make some really stupid stupid fucking choices. \u003ci\u003eFreedom\u003c/i\u003e is complex and well-written but, while the characters’ inner monologues ring truthful, their broad decisions and circumstances often do not. I think Franzen is addressing the “freedom” theme with a focus on how Americans in particular face such a intimidating array of potentialities and the sense that you made the “right” one is almost impossible to attain. On Tuesday you might be in love with your husband but six months later leaving him might feel \u003ci\u003eperfect\u003c/i\u003e. Which choice is a sign of truth and which of selfishness? Are you repressing emotions you don’t understand? How well do you know your own motivations? If you stay in a dead marriage are you dooming yourself to decades of regret? What if the marriage isn’t really dead but dormant? What internal perspectives do you control that transcend success and failures? Who can you trust if you don’t know yourself, and how well, really, can you know yourself? These are important questions, and Franzen starts the colloquy well, but these people and storylines function as privileged archetypes except when the plot-architect in Franzen’s consciousness decides to throw a curve here and there because he knows he’s supposed to do so. Franzen is sometimes too meta for his own novels’ good.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eFreedom\u003c/i\u003e also lacks timelessness. In twenty years readers will need endnotes with designations like “Jeff Tweedy: leader of Wilco, an influential country rock band” or “NPR: National Public Radio, an over-the-airwaves audio news station often associated with affluent liberals”. In attempting to catch the spirit of the age Franzen has focused on details that will lack future context. I guess that’s ok. I doubt he’s writing for people 100 years down the road and the details add to the novel’s landscape. This is a book for white people (uh, except Oprah, I guess) with good intentions who listen to NPR, went to college, and kind of hate themselves sometimes. Some of these people, apparently, assign awards and press coverage to literature and a weird cottage industry has emerged around slamming/endorsing Jonathan Franzen’s work. I’m going to leave that conversation to others because I don’t care much one way or the other. You want to argue that one, knock yourself out. I’ll be over here. Franzen mistakes aiming high with these characters, as far as themes are considered, for universiality. And I’m not sure that some of the characters’ wild swerves are more than the author’s personal regrets and fantasies. Listen. I’m going to say that Franzen doesn’t tread this territory as well as, say, Dostoevsky. But remember, then, I’m \u003ci\u003eplacing his work in the same sentence as Dostoevsky\u003c/i\u003e. I can’t think of many writers alive who can touch his technique. Future generations’ English majors will probably read this novel in a class called “American novels: 2000-2050” and write term papers with titles like “Materialism and Self-Identity in Jonathan Franzen’s \u003ci\u003eFreedom\u003c/i\u003e”. They’ll probably get A’s. Franzen, I think, has lived in that literary subculture for a long time, and he’s good at delivering material that exemplifies the best it has to offer. He’s a brilliant technician, and I like brilliant technique, but I’m not sure I loved \u003ci\u003eFreedom\u003c/i\u003e as much as I admired it. \u003ci\u003eFreedom\u003c/i\u003e is commendable but not great, expansive but nervous in its own expanse. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAlso, I wish I read something less fucking depressing the week before Christmas. But that’s my fault. I should know better.

He does not seem like a douche bag, at all. In fact, despite all the Oprah hoopla (Which he described as a fiasco, not because of anything that he or Oprah did, but because the whole thing got blown out of proportion.) and the backlash after the early raves for \u003ci\u003eFreedom\u003c/i\u003e, Franzen came across as remarkably down-to-earth and funny. He seems like a very smart guy who doesn’t take the media hype too seriously, but is clearly having a lot of fun with all the recent attention.*\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eI picked up Jonathan Franzen’s \u003ci\u003eThe Corrections\u003c/i\u003e earlier this summer, and it was one of the oddest reading experiences of my life because while I despised nearly every character in it, I still enjoyed the book. So when I started \u003ci\u003eFreedom\u003c/i\u003e, I was hoping that I’d find some more likeable people in this one. After fifty pages, I was horrified to realize that it was looking like this book would be another collection of self-absorbed asshats.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAt that point, I thought there were two possibilities: 1) That Jonathan Franzen is a complete douche bag himself and that he actually thought he was creating sympathetic characters. 2) That Franzen has an even lower opinion of people than I do and uses his skill to convey an utter contempt for mankind by creating these pathetic excuses for human beings. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eHowever, as I got deeper into \u003ci\u003eFreedom\u003c/i\u003e, and we started getting the history and alternate view points, I started to sympathize with most of the characters. (Except for Joey. I hated that smug little bastard through the entire thing and was really hoping that he‘d get set on fire at some point.)\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe Berglunds seem like a prime example of family-first socially conscious living. They bought a house in a run down St. Paul neighborhood and became the first wave of gentrification for that area. Walter is a lawyer who works on environmental causes. Patty was a talented college basketball player who channels all her old competitive instincts into being the best mother and neighbor possible. The two kids, Jessica and Joey, are intelligent and seem destined for big things. And just to give them a touch of cool in their suburban existence, Patty and Walter are old friends with Richard Katz, a womanizing musician who has just gained mainstream popularity.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eBut the Berglunds quickly fall apart in spectacular fashion. Joey moves in with a neighbor after rebelling against Patty’s overwhelming love, and he and Walter can’t have a conversation without it turning into a screaming match. Patty has turned into a lost and bitter shadow of her former self. Walter has left his old environmental job to work with a rich man with ties to the coal industry, and as the kids leave for college, the parents are off to D.C. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe novel covers a tremendous amount of ground, not just with the elaborate characterizations, but in terms of the backdrops. From Minnesota to New York to DC to West Virginia to South America, Franzen touches on 9/11, the Iraq war, environmentalism, overpopulation, rampant consumerism and the political fracturing of America, but by keeping it in terms of a family disintegration, he keeps the story relatable.\u003cbr /\u003e \u003cbr /\u003eOne of the key things that comes up repeatedly is the idea that Americans have about freedom. It’s a word tossed around easily, and as Franzen explores here, many take it as their God given right to engage in mass consumption and lead completely unexamined lives with no regard for the consequences. Those who ask for more social responsibility are derided as ‘liberals’ and ‘intellectuals’ and ’elitists’. (I’m pretty sure Sarah Palin would hate this book. Assuming she could find someone to read it to her and explain the big words.) \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eBut this isn’t about idealizing liberal policies. Franzen makes a lot of valid points about how American politics has become a constant screaming match more concerned with beating the other guy than accomplishing anything. He makes good use of the character of Walter to illustrate how all the pent up rage and frustration, even for a ‘good’ cause, can make for a pretty miserable life. What good is trying to save the world if you can’t stand any of the people in it?\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eTerrific book that’s almost a pitch perfect statement about what American life has been like since 2000 as seen through the eyes of some flawed, but decent people. (Except for Joey. That kid is a prick.) While freedom and happiness are usually considered to go hand-in-hand, these characters show that poorly used freedom can make you supremely unhappy.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eRandom thoughts:\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e-There’s several similarities to \u003ci\u003eThe Corrections\u003c/i\u003e: Everyone hates their family. There’s a very odd love triangle. A mother/son relationship is pushed to creepy extremes to irritate a father. A character gets caught up in an elaborate overseas get-rich-quick scheme. The daughter of the family is probably the most adult and sensible character. And there’s a really nasty scene involving human turds. Eww. What’s with all the poop, Franzen?\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e- One of my favorite parts was Richard Katz’s interview where he makes several hilarious comments about the music industry.\u003cbr /\u003e \u003cbr /\u003e-\u003ci\u003eThe personality susceptible to the dream of limitless freedom is a personality, also prone, should the dream ever sour, to misanthropy and rage.\u003c/i\u003e That’s just about my entire existence summed up in one sentence.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e- There’s a plot point involving cats attacking song birds late in the book. Just as I was reading this section, a stray cat came up on our deck and tried to attack one of our two house kitties through the door screen. It was very startling to be reading about feral cats and then hear godawful yowling, hissing, screeching and general mayhem in the next room. For a second, I thought Franzen was so good that he caused me to have audio hallucinations. \u003cbr /\u003e","rating":5,"shelving":{"__typename":"Shelving","shelf":{"__typename":"Shelf","name":"read","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/405390?shelf=read"},"taggings":[{"__typename":"Tagging","tag":{"__typename":"Tag","name":"signed-by-author","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/405390?shelf=signed-by-author"}},{"__typename":"Tagging","tag":{"__typename":"Tag","name":"modern-lit","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/405390?shelf=modern-lit"}}],"webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/114515036"},"likeCount":351,"viewerHasLiked":null,"commentCount":43,"viewerCanComment({\"resourceType\":\"review\"})":null},"User:100071":{"id":100071,"__typename":"User","legacyId":100071,"imageUrlSquare":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/users/1180559628i/100071.jpg","isAuthor":false,"textReviewsCount":162,"viewableName":"Ben","isBlockedByViewer":false,"webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/100071-ben","contributor":null,"isFollowing":false,"isFriend":false,"followersCount":15},"Review:kca://review:goodreads/amzn1.gr.review:goodreads.v1.lHkG1BR2r2wSqAiiiydxlg":{"id":"kca://review:goodreads/amzn1.gr.review:goodreads.v1.lHkG1BR2r2wSqAiiiydxlg","__typename":"Review","book":{"__ref":"Book:kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.tU6Ck7D-_YmEkOIJSkV9JA"},"creator":{"__ref":"User:100071"},"recommendFor":null,"updatedAt":1643014245245,"createdAt":1277911876000,"spoilerStatus":false,"lastRevisionAt":1312310121000,"text":"Here's the thing about this book: I was really expecting to enjoy it. I say that for two reasons. The first is The Corrections. Not the book itself, which is still quietly residing on my shelf, waiting for its day in the sun… Nay, I speak of the buzz. You see, I know people. And a lot of those people read things. And some of those things were their own copies of The Corrections. And the buzz was, as far as I could tell, that the people that I know liked The Corrections. In fact, their only complaint seemed to be that there were no likeable characters in the book, that they all seemed petty and kind of horrible. But,… (and here's the twist),… that actually sounded like a selling point to me. Because, I'm actually a little petty myself, I'm prone to dabble in misanthropy and, besides, who doesn't love a good antihero? \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe second reason that I was ready to love Freedom is that I have read a touch of Franzen in my day. Not much, mind you. But I found How To Be Alone an incredibly well-crafted and insightful read. I was struck by the way the collection dealt reasonably with the complicated position of literarily minded folk in a digital age. I was so taken with How To Be Alone, in fact, that I thought there was simply no way that Freedom could be bad. Even if it wasn't overflowing with goodness, it certainly wouldn't be unpleasant. In short, my formal adoration of Freedom was simply a forgone conclusion, an eventuality waiting to transpire.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eOh, me.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eLet me break off a little truth for you. I hated reading this book. The thing that's frustrating about it is that there is no one quality that makes it bad. The characters are unlikeable, but not in a devil-may-care, what-will-they-do-next kind of way. The characters are odious because they are self-absorbed and petty… but more than that, they're insufferably boring. It's not that they don't wander around hurting each other; it's that their sins are largely those of inaction or inertia; that they sit around and complain to themselves and moan on about their disappointments, and you find yourself relieved when they actually take action of some kind, no matter what it is, simply because it means something is happening in the book, that you are reading a novel wherein events happen that have significance. And you quickly find that you not only start to wish the characters thorough unhappiness, but further, you actually long for some kind horrible nuclear disaster to clear the slate so that Franzen can just start over with an entirely new cast midway through the novel.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe truth is that I tried really, really hard to hold out hope for the novel. The point of no return for me was right around when the author intimates that everyone secretly enjoys the smell of their own flatulence. [Cue my head slamming into the table I was reading at.] In all honesty, I didn't just dislike the book. I came to resent the very existence of the world in which the characters existed. It made me wish the Genesis had never happened, that God had refrained from rendering form out of the formless at all. I would rather read Jonathon Franzen's descriptions of the void than another wretched moment in the lives of these abysmal characters.\u003cbr /\u003e","rating":1,"shelving":{"__typename":"Shelving","shelf":{"__typename":"Shelf","name":"read","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/100071?shelf=read"},"taggings":[],"webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/109432952"},"likeCount":210,"viewerHasLiked":null,"commentCount":40,"viewerCanComment({\"resourceType\":\"review\"})":null},"User:419287":{"id":419287,"__typename":"User","legacyId":419287,"imageUrlSquare":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/users/1289534648i/419287._UY200_CR33,0,200,200_.jpg","isAuthor":false,"textReviewsCount":593,"viewableName":"Jessica","isBlockedByViewer":false,"webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/419287-jessica","contributor":null,"isFollowing":false,"isFriend":false,"followersCount":3368},"Review:kca://review:goodreads/amzn1.gr.review:goodreads.v1.j4rg6VDAsITrO6CKIq_8xA":{"id":"kca://review:goodreads/amzn1.gr.review:goodreads.v1.j4rg6VDAsITrO6CKIq_8xA","__typename":"Review","book":{"__ref":"Book:kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.tU6Ck7D-_YmEkOIJSkV9JA"},"creator":{"__ref":"User:419287"},"recommendFor":"see review","updatedAt":1639794290633,"createdAt":1284219801000,"spoilerStatus":false,"lastRevisionAt":1284722388000,"text":"Okay, so earlier this summer I was waiting to see The National play Prospect Park (\u003ci\u003e\"Of course you were, Jessica....\u003c/i\u003e\" -- but bear with me, that's my point), and I sent a text message to the guy who'd given me the tickets, thanking him again and observing that \"White People don't LIKE seeing The National play Prospect Park; White People LOVE seeing The National play Prospect Park.\" This was a reference, of course, to the oft-quoted blog that holds a very high place on the seemingly endless list it identified, of Stuff White People Like. Now, I've always felt a bit annoyed and repelled by the lazy shorthand of race there, then ashamed when I use it myself -- since really the demographic group in question is, like the crowd at the bandshell, not exclusively white, and since there are millions of white people whom it does not describe -- but the concept's too pricelessly apt to resist frequent citing.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe brilliance of Stuff White People Like is in its identification of a socioeconomic group which is, yes, largely white, but more to the point Obama-voting, liberal arts degree-holding, farmers market-shopping, NPR-listening, irony-appreciating, \u003ci\u003eNew Yorker\u003c/i\u003e-subscribing, boutique cable show-watching, indie-rock-listening, Clash tee-shirt-wearing baby-rearing, freelance-or-nonprofit-job-working, and neighborhood-gentrifying, but also profoundly self-loathing in a weird and specific way that is a bit hard either to detach from or reconcile with its incredible self-absorption and uncomfortable, only partly ironic smugness and conviction that the stuff it likes is \u003ci\u003egood\u003c/i\u003e.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eJonathan Franzen should be on the list of Stuff White People Like, but he should also be on the (perhaps equivalent) list of Stuff White People Don't Want To Like But Do, which reflects the ambivalent discomfort of this particular group. We don't want to like Franzen, because we're supposed to, and that contrarian streak is built into our bones. And to add to all that, Franzen writes about -- and nails -- our very essence. I can't think of another book that so perfectly sums up and explores the attributes and complexities of this particular set.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eOkay, enough with all this generalization: did this white person like \u003ci\u003eFreedom\u003c/i\u003e? Well okay, the first 190 pages was the most fun I've had in years. And I did really like \u003ci\u003eFreedom\u003c/i\u003e, and wish I could give it three-point-five stars. My criterion for the fourth star is that I itch to read it, and I itched like crazy while reading it. Yeah, this book was \u003ci\u003egood.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eA confession: my behavior while traveling in public, and especially on mass transit, can best be described as sociopathic. If you live in this city -- and perhaps even more likely if you don't, but have visited -- there's a fair chance I've harmed you physically while I ran for the train. Sorry, but you probably don't walk fast enough, and I was trying to get to the platform. The TRAIN might be coming, and I GOT to be on it!!! Understand that I am in a great hurry to arrive in short order wherever I'm going, which is somewhat inexplicable since once I'm there I don't have much to do, and will probably just sit there, dicking around on the Internet; but while I'm en route, I'm a terror, and slow old ladies be damned! I'll hit them with my umbrella! I'll give them all flat tires! But while reading \u003ci\u003eFreedom\u003c/i\u003e the number of citywide subway station stair assaults must have dropped; I was in no particular hurry to get where I was headed, and often took the local train or waited for the next less-crowded car. I took crosstown buses where normally I motor on foot, and rode elevators instead of my usual mad running up the stairs. Over the past week, I honestly looked forward to my commute, and to deadtime at work waiting in a courtroom, because these moments gave me another opportunity to read. This is one of two of the most important tests of a book: it was so entertaining and so fabulously engaging that I wanted to pick it up at actually all times.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe other test, though, \u003ci\u003eFreedom\u003c/i\u003e didn't really pass. I did vastly enjoy a lot of this book, but it didn't give me the more rare and elusive experience that's the other main thing that I want when I'm reading. I didn't ultimately feel moved, not emotionally or ontologically. I didn't see the world, or my life, in an earthshaking new way (I did start wondering briefly about how my parents might've fucked me up, but not in a fruitful way, so I don't think that counts). And while I did definitely like it, and got involved with the characters, by the end I felt disappointed, and also pretty bored.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eSorry, this is already pretty long and not much of a review. Let's see, \u003ci\u003eFreedom\u003c/i\u003e is a novel about a family, the Berglunds, and if you want to read a good review of it, I defer to Mike Reynolds. I myself was instantly hooked from the beginning chapter, which is a description of the family from the perspective of the community where they live, and I loved -- \u003ci\u003eloved\u003c/i\u003e -- the next portion, an \"autobiography\" (wonderfully titled \"Mistakes Were Made\") by the wife, Patty Berglund, which takes us up to page 187. But I'm afraid that for me, things did peak there, and I'm a bit baffled by all the buzz about \"greatest living American writer\" and \"genius.\" I did like this book. But it wasn't \u003ci\u003ethat\u003c/i\u003e great.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eSo but like, I really don't follow these things, but full disclosure, I couldn't free myself while reading from thoughts about the Author, and I really don't think that this was just me. Other reviews on this site have noted that the characters are all a lot the same, but I don't really see that as a problem, and that's kind of what I liked about it. For me, the only character that never really came off was daughter Jessica, which I maybe took too personally, as that is my name (I did like the part where Jessica agonizes over the impossibility of finding a decent New York guy to go out with, though I liked it more in the abstract, and wanted its execution to be more amazing). I felt a bit shortchanged when it came to the son's relationship with his lady; there were all the seeds to be sown, and then we just stopped hearing about them. But my point partly, with the Franzenness, was that the two parents did feel very real, maybe the more so for seeming like two only slightly varying manifestations of the same certain guy.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eHere's my beef about Jonathan Franzen, and I know I should do some more google research before I start on with this, but I'm feeling kind of lazy, and I doubt anyone's still reading this.... See, I associate him, like a lot of people, with that Oprah thing in the nineties, when he withdrew from being in the Oprah bookclub, got lots of shit, and as a result (maybe) became wildly popular. Franzen's Wikipedia article has a quotation from him at that time, in which he explains that he didn't want people thinking \u003ci\u003eThe Corrections\u003c/i\u003e was a women's book (by \"people\" I mean men, of course) and therefore not reading it. Now again, I'm only dimly aware of what's been going on recently, but I've heard lady authors are bitching (like we do) about all the press and blowjobs Franzen's been getting, and suggesting that this is really all because of that Y-chromosome he has. And honestly, I was distracted while reading this by my conviction that it's true.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eI don't want to plagiarize, though I can't remember who said it, but some upset woman I read at some point was complaining about the \"chick lit\" ghetto and said that Franzen writes what are essentially domestic novels, and that if he weren't a man they'd be considered women's fiction. And that, friend, is \u003ci\u003etrue.\u003c/i\u003e It is painfully true. Especially the better, earlier, female-perspectived portion of this novel is all about relationships and a marriage and family, and all those lady things. And if Jonathan were Jessica Franzen, at least half the readers he has (except Mike Reynolds, boy wonder, who actually reads stuff by chicks!) would never have touched it and it would've had some dumb pinky cover, but because he's a man, it's a Serious Novel. Yeah, actually I do really think that. Without all the male masturbation and the obviously male author, this could've so easily been written off as chick lit. And it makes me -- perhaps unjustly -- hate Jonathan Franzen to think that he might not recognize that. It might not seem this way, but I'm not one of those people who carries on endlessly about WhiteMalePrivilege, but I actually do want to with him. Because he gets the kind of attention that similarly talented women wouldn't get, while writing about topics that aren't considered Serious when women write about them.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eOkay, I'm sorry, I'm rambling again (really bad day at work, srsly, sorry). This book, hm, well what more can I say? Franzen is a terrific writer, and I loved the addictive easiness of his prose style, which can unfortunately come back and bite an author because it makes any glitch seem egregious. I hated the partial sentences that seemed to creep in more as the novel progressed, though I might not have noticed them if his writing weren't otherwise so perfect. He writes sentences as readable as the most digestible best-seller, but good. The problem is that being that good makes people angrier if you let them down. (Especially if those people are me, and apply ridiculously high standards to anything they have great hopes for, while giving tons of social work sympathy to the obvious losers. You guys should hope that I never have children! I'll criticize and neglect the good kid, while coddling the fuck-up.)\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eOkay, I did feel let down by this book; again, I really liked it. But by the end I felt bored by the characters, especially by depression (which is deadly boring; note my biases, as a reader who was unable to make it all the way through David Foster Wallace's short story \"The Depressed Person\" despite thinking it brilliant), and I really thought the plot and characters ran off the road at later points into melodrama. At a certain early juncture I felt sure our Berglunds' marriage would survive, though I wasn't sure I cared that it did, or what that had to do with me.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eBut don't get me wrong! This was a very fine novel. Frazen's ability to create characters is wonderful, and the whole thing's pretty zeitgeisty, which is nice in this dying form. No, sorry Jonathan: it's not \u003ci\u003eWar and Peace\u003c/i\u003e. But in its mostly successful efforts to link the narcissistic and eerily familiar concerns of individuals to the larger events and forces of our time, it is a lot closer than anything recent I can think of.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eBest of all, now I have something to fall back on, the next time I'm at a Brooklyn party and the White People are all talking about \u003ci\u003eTrue Blood\u003c/i\u003e. \"Haven't seen it,\" I'll admit, as I swig a microbrew. \"But have you read \u003ci\u003eFreedom\u003c/i\u003e?\"\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAnd we'll take it from there.","rating":3,"shelving":{"__typename":"Shelving","shelf":{"__typename":"Shelf","name":"read","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/419287?shelf=read"},"taggings":[{"__typename":"Tagging","tag":{"__typename":"Tag","name":"crazy-ladies","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/419287?shelf=crazy-ladies"}},{"__typename":"Tagging","tag":{"__typename":"Tag","name":"chicklits","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/419287?shelf=chicklits"}},{"__typename":"Tagging","tag":{"__typename":"Tag","name":"groups-of-people","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/419287?shelf=groups-of-people"}},{"__typename":"Tagging","tag":{"__typename":"Tag","name":"love-and-other-indoor-sports","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/419287?shelf=love-and-other-indoor-sports"}},{"__typename":"Tagging","tag":{"__typename":"Tag","name":"dicklits","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/419287?shelf=dicklits"}}],"webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/121144453"},"likeCount":143,"viewerHasLiked":null,"commentCount":29,"viewerCanComment({\"resourceType\":\"review\"})":null},"User:416390":{"id":416390,"__typename":"User","legacyId":416390,"imageUrlSquare":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/users/1224113172i/416390._UX200_CR0,47,200,200_.jpg","isAuthor":false,"textReviewsCount":2068,"viewableName":"Paul Bryant","isBlockedByViewer":false,"webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/416390-paul-bryant","contributor":null,"isFollowing":false,"isFriend":false,"followersCount":7703},"Review:kca://review:goodreads/amzn1.gr.review:goodreads.v1.NH6hvB5XzqFEcCDP3d4BTA":{"id":"kca://review:goodreads/amzn1.gr.review:goodreads.v1.NH6hvB5XzqFEcCDP3d4BTA","__typename":"Review","book":{"__ref":"Book:kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.tU6Ck7D-_YmEkOIJSkV9JA"},"creator":{"__ref":"User:416390"},"recommendFor":null,"updatedAt":1634062294748,"createdAt":1285758780000,"spoilerStatus":false,"lastRevisionAt":1386196904000,"text":"This book hoovers you into its world from the first page and before you know what's what you've missed your bus stop and you are \u003ci\u003einto it\u003c/i\u003e.

I could not divest myself of the realisation that things were getting soapier by the minute – no, I said, to any passing stranger who I could get to take an interest in the current state of literature, this is Jonathan Franzen messing with our heads, taunting us with the cardboardy and the cutouty.

For vein-throbbing brain-melding attempts to encompass the economics of Iraqi reconstruction contracts, mountaintop removal mining, songbird conservation and sundry other realities of the world's most modern country, and embed all of this into sketches of how two or three complicated families live from day to day and year to year, to pull all this together – well actually, a lot of the time it’s like JF is flailing away at his material, not the assured mover of chess pieces on the board but the frantically photographing \u0026amp; camcording and ambulance-chasing kind of novelist who rushes around after his many characters \u0026amp; can’t quite keep up with them all. That part of the whole thing I liked. But oh – phrases like\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eHis thing with Connie was too intense and strange – too sincere, too muddled with love- to be fungible as coin of bragging.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eand\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eConnie had a wry compact intelligence, a firm little clitoris of discernment and sensitivity\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eand\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eKatz’s blood was up, he was all jittery-jangly. It was like coke cut heavily with nasty meth.\u003c/i\u003e (Is this a simile JF thinks will ring bells with his readers? No, so it’s something his character the egregious Katz would think. But then how does this translate its meaning to the non coke-cut-heavily-with-nasty-meth-hoovering reader? It translates as : \u003ci\u003eIt was really quite unpleasant or I assume so. \u003c/i\u003eMaybe if the meth was nice he’d be just jangly and not jittery too. Oh I don’t know. )\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAnyway - pretty ghastly. And - oh well, while I’m moaning and griping, here’s some more. On occasion Franzen goes into page long riffs on such things as road rage or the stupid things that teenagers do - these are exactly like riffs in a stand up comedian's routine. They’re quite fun in a sneery sort of way but they do seem like JF is getting a bit of humour in there in case he gets accused of having written another Big Depressing Hell In A Handbasket Novel, which really, this is (Iraq, global warning, environmental destruction, overpopulation, oh oh oh woe is us woe is us, smite us Lord, we fully deserve every last smite).\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAnd : now obviously JF does not wish to do this, but every time one of his young characters (say Jessica) berates one of his slightly less young characters (say Lalitha) for being out of touch with they way young people do right now (e.g not knowing that kids have mostly abandoned emailing for texting) he, JF, is perforce, as author, advertising just how down with the kids he himself is, which, alas and alack, is kind of like seeing your 52 year old uncle do the Twist. No, the Frug. No, I mean that Body Pop thing. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAnd - this book is built out of sturdy slabs of knowingness and social nuance. You have to get what’s intended by the great many phrases like “in the earliest years when you could drive a Volvo 240 without feeling self-conscious”. Well, maybe some of us can’t quite be bothered to rack our brains to think what a Volvo 240 is and why it became something you would be ashamed of. (JF : Well, do your homework then. I want active engaged readers. PB : Yeah, I know, sorry and all. But I did finish your damned big book. So, you know, be quiet.)\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eJF in a Freedom-promoting interview said that the most important thing he should be doing in his novels is\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e‘To find an adequate narrative vehicle for the most difficult stuff at the core of me, in the hope that that might resonate with the reader who otherwise has been feeling alone with those deep, difficult feelings.’\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eWell, he tried, he really tried, and for a great number of star-besprinkling reviewers, he succeeded. It’s good, it is … er… good, long but good, long long long but quite good. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e","rating":3,"shelving":{"__typename":"Shelving","shelf":{"__typename":"Shelf","name":"read","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/416390?shelf=read"},"taggings":[{"__typename":"Tagging","tag":{"__typename":"Tag","name":"novels","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/416390?shelf=novels"}}],"webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/123928451"},"likeCount":128,"viewerHasLiked":null,"commentCount":45,"viewerCanComment({\"resourceType\":\"review\"})":null},"User:864382":{"id":864382,"__typename":"User","legacyId":864382,"imageUrlSquare":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/users/1301064965i/864382._UX200_CR0,42,200,200_.jpg","isAuthor":false,"textReviewsCount":218,"viewableName":"Katie","isBlockedByViewer":false,"webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/864382-katie","contributor":null,"isFollowing":false,"isFriend":false,"followersCount":106},"Review:kca://review:goodreads/amzn1.gr.review:goodreads.v1.kOIQAa2Zpi7lxOIciJhLfw":{"id":"kca://review:goodreads/amzn1.gr.review:goodreads.v1.kOIQAa2Zpi7lxOIciJhLfw","__typename":"Review","book":{"__ref":"Book:kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.tU6Ck7D-_YmEkOIJSkV9JA"},"creator":{"__ref":"User:864382"},"recommendFor":null,"updatedAt":1641583655606,"createdAt":1287063459000,"spoilerStatus":false,"lastRevisionAt":1297019052000,"text":"\u003ci\u003eFreedom\u003c/i\u003e is Terrible, by Katie G. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003e(Abridged for your convenience in list form)\u003c/i\u003e \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eBefore you think I'm mean, please note that \"freedom is terrible\" is kind of the point of Franzen's book: Freedom doesn't get you what you want.

You know, jerks, dickwads, the stoney cold and self-involved, the pompously mean and rich or bitterly poor and junk-addled characters loitering about within the pages of many harder-to-swallow books. Personally, I have both experienced a lot of shittiness in life \u003ci\u003eand\u003c/i\u003e inflicted it on others, so I find it important and enlightening to read about just how much people (of which I am one) can and often do royally suck to and about one another. I don't need a likable lead in order to power through a book, and I in fact very often desire just the opposite. There can be a richness to such characters, an honesty which is frequently lacking in Hero-like characters and/or the tragically trampled upon, naively and purely good souls featured in more soul-massaging, hopeful literature. And \u003ci\u003eFreedom\u003c/i\u003e is (mostly) not a nice tale. It is, rather, almost 600 pages about assholes and asshats being assholes and asshats to each other to varying degrees over a long period of time. It is not a tale for happy housewives, no matter what Oprah Winfrey said about it.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eFreedom\u003c/i\u003e teeters for me: I offer it a respectful four stars, but as I distance myself from it, I can already see it wobbling near the edge about to drop back into the 3-star realm. Don't get me wrong: I enjoyed the book. It is not sloggy at all; the little time it takes to breeze through this thing seems almost unfair to the actual physical bulk of the text. I never found myself bored or bogged down, and I felt invested in the outcome of the story to the very last page. I think a lot of what helped keep up the pace was the fact that the story was told from the viewpoint of several different narrators, all interconnected, providing shifts in style and perspective which made for a more rounded out experience of the events, and a deeper understanding of the individual players in this drama (their motives, needs, baggage, etc). However, even with the inside scoop, something kept bothering me about these particular assholes/hats. They seemed almost...too familiar? Flat in a lot of ways, despite the time and effort put into rounding them out? I know a lot of people may disagree with me about this, but hear me out if you would be so kind. Here is a brief description of each of the main characters:\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eWalter: \u003ci\u003eThe Guy You Are Supposed To Pity\u003c/i\u003e. Sweet, ideological, overachieving, good friend, good husband, good citizen, liberal, book-smart, giving, loving, naive, nature-preserving Walter...you know, the rug for the more venomous characters' feet, the guy who never does wrong by anybody, and so spends his life being sucked dry by Shitty Friend Generic Rock Star Studs and She-Beasts. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003ePatty: \u003ci\u003eThe She-Beast\u003c/i\u003e. Selfish, underachieving, shitty wife, shitty mother, vortex of negativity and self-pity, wine-sluggin', two-timin', emotional breakdown-havin', bi-polar Patty. She is the thorn in many a side, and is presumably only happy when playing basketball, interacting with her Mirror Image With a Penis of a son, booze-binging till a purge, or engaging in torrid sexual encounters with some Shitty Friend Generic Rock Star Stud.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eRichard: \u003ci\u003eThe Shitty Friend Generic Rock Star Stud\u003c/i\u003e: Oh, this one's my favorite. Here's a guy in a band who likes to sleep with his much younger fans (surprise!) and best friend's crushes and girlfriends (oh no!), has off and on substance abuse problems (whaaaat?), doesn't really know himself until it is too late (you're kidding me) and is a ramblin' man who can never really give a part of his heart to anyone or be meaningful at all in anyone's life but his own because gifted musicians are apparently wholly incapable of multi-tasking on any level whatsoever. (Aside from, of course, the sex-aaaay seXXX level, since all musicians are spectacular in bed...spectacular and \u003ci\u003erough\u003c/i\u003e! Didn't you know that?) There is a bit of depth hidden within Richard's brotherly love for Walter and distant longing for Walter and Patty's \"normal life,\" but even these somewhat numb feelings are...let's say \"misplaced.\" I'll stop here with Richard, since if I say anything more, there will only be a few crumbles of substance left for the novel to reveal. Simply put, you have for the most part heard it all before in any random teen movie. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eChild Unit 1: \u003ci\u003ePatty With A Penis\u003c/i\u003e (aka Joey): All the traits of Patty, only politically conservative, money hungry, and penis-having.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eChild Unit 2: \u003ci\u003eWalter With A Vag\u003c/i\u003e (aka Jessica): Most of the traits of Walter, with far, far less character development than basically anyone else in the book. She is about as important to this story and the family within it, as prized, as a 2nd or 3rd born girl-child in China.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eConnie: \u003ci\u003eThe Inspirational Doormat\u003c/i\u003e: The neighbor girl. She teaches young women that if you blindly love someone, tailor all your life decisions around him and his whims, deal with him ignoring you for months at a time, cheating on you repeatedly, and generally treating you like shit, and then you apologize profusely for bothering him by mentioning any of it, things may work out for you after all. If you really start feeling isolated and pathetic, just sleep around and then call him to tell him all about it: that'll get him knockin' at your window again. Work it, girl!\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eI have typed a lot of words here, but I have mostly focused on what pissed me off and ignored what I appreciated about this novel. There are other characters of notable importance that I have failed to mention, and there is generally more to the ones that I have brought up. However, the basic shells still stand, and they feel redundant. You have seen this film a dozen times, you know how the drama plays out, and yet Franzen is rich with the gifts of both believable dialogue and perfect pacing, so he somehow manages to pull it all together into an engaging story. You feel for most of the characters, no matter how much you may dislike them. I guess the other thing about the novel that really got to me was this twist on the above characters: rather than simply standing as unawares examples of common character motifs, these people were all terribly hyper-aware of themselves. Unlike most storybook characters who see their own motivations as pure and good, yet come to find themselves shocked by their own bad behavior, Franzen's characters fully dissect and execute their plans of being horrible to one another in advance, and come to find themselves instead shocked by their inherent goodness. They seem \u003ci\u003esurprised\u003c/i\u003e that they even give a shit about each other and the world around them. I know people often trick and misread themselves leading to much mistake-making, but do people actually analyze themselves as much as Franzen's characters do and consider the awful shit they pull so thoroughly beforehand only to find in the end that they didn't really know anything about themselves and actually just really, really lurrrrrve each other? \u003ci\u003eReally\u003c/i\u003e? \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eSorry to complain so much. Again, I did enjoy this book. You probably will, too. Just be forewarned that there are a lot of predictably soapy scenes coming from a lot of predictably soapy characters, they are often mean as shit to one another, and their heads are for the most part buried deeply within their behinds: assholes and asshats. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eOh, one more thing: I waited so long to read this guy because I mixed him up with the Jon F who wrote \u003ci\u003eEverything is Illuminated\u003c/i\u003e, and (for no good reason aside from a vague annoyance with that movie) simply the idea of that book and its author got on my nerves. I was wrong, so I gave this novel a shot. I'll probably read another Franzen.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e*Upon reflection, this is getting downgraded to a 3. I'm too nice with these stars...so I'm putting my foot down, dammit!

It is like my friend Maciek, who tells me a story and in the middle of it he remembers some other story that might or might not be related to the story he is telling me so he tells me that other story, and then some other story that somehow came from the second story, and then maybe he will return to the main story and you end up wondering if the second story actually happened in the middle of the first story or it was just his way of telling a story.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe final moral from this book is that we are all fucked up in our own special way but it will all be alright unless, of course, we become Republicans, in which case there will be no redemption. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eIt almost killed me. This book almost killed me. But as they say what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger, therefore this book made stronger, so for that alone I had to give it two stars. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eI will admit that Patty and Walter were both interesting characters with all the supporting cast being all sorts of caricatures and serving as props to the main duo.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eNow, I am off to read a book about people who do things and have real problems.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e*UPDATE - oh yeah. And I also forgot to say that if this book was written by a woman, it would be deemed chick lit and stuck in a pastel colour cover with birds and flowers. No one would even look at it twice because there is so much better chick lit out there. But as Jonathan Franzen is lucky enough to be a man, this, all of a sudden, is the Great American Novel. DON'T MAKE ME LAUGH.\u003cbr /\u003eIf anyone else claims there is no sexism in literary/publishing world, this here is my best demonstrative evidence that there is. Honest to God, who would take this book seriously if it was written by a woman and had something pink on the cover?\u003cbr /\u003e","rating":2,"shelving":{"__typename":"Shelving","shelf":{"__typename":"Shelf","name":"read","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/110812?shelf=read"},"taggings":[{"__typename":"Tagging","tag":{"__typename":"Tag","name":"pub-2010","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/110812?shelf=pub-2010"}}],"webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/153837369"},"likeCount":95,"viewerHasLiked":null,"commentCount":21,"viewerCanComment({\"resourceType\":\"review\"})":null},"User:236411":{"id":236411,"__typename":"User","legacyId":236411,"imageUrlSquare":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/users/1291695844i/236411.jpg","isAuthor":false,"textReviewsCount":251,"viewableName":"Steve","isBlockedByViewer":false,"webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/236411-steve","contributor":null,"isFollowing":false,"isFriend":false,"followersCount":827},"Review:kca://review:goodreads/amzn1.gr.review:goodreads.v1.q-iX791cdk0yFovW_0I_UQ":{"id":"kca://review:goodreads/amzn1.gr.review:goodreads.v1.q-iX791cdk0yFovW_0I_UQ","__typename":"Review","book":{"__ref":"Book:kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.tU6Ck7D-_YmEkOIJSkV9JA"},"creator":{"__ref":"User:236411"},"recommendFor":null,"updatedAt":1641404374964,"createdAt":1299775598000,"spoilerStatus":false,"lastRevisionAt":1299776009000,"text":"Times I hear, “You either love him or hate him,” I often both love him \u003ci\u003eand\u003c/i\u003e hate him. In feeling lukewarm, there’s a distinction to be made in how you got there. To find every aspect average is not the same as combining extreme likes and dislikes that tally to the same net amount. I’d rather feel strongly both ways. So here’s my highly variable assessment of Franzen and his latest.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eOn the “like” side of the ledger, I have to give him his due for being one helluva good writer. His sentences flow, his words are well-chosen, and his observations (of which there are many) are made in an interesting way. I also liked how he alternated among his four point-of-view characters. He doesn’t half-ass it in developing them either. I noticed, too, more redeeming qualities in these people compared to the dyspeptic family in his previous would-be classic, \u003ci\u003eThe Corrections\u003c/i\u003e. At least for a while that’s what I thought. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eBut Franzen’s tendency towards acrimony eventually plays out. Everyone has problems, nobody’s happy for long, and they lash out fiercely, often indiscriminately. In a way it was more depressing this time because for some characters, over some stretches, he actually made me care. I can handle “dark”, and sometimes even “bleak”, but for Franzen’s cast, they didn’t seem to come by it honestly. Walter and Patty, the married couple, were every bit as inconstant (and not just towards each other) as they were intelligent (or at least meant to be). Their inconsistencies didn’t ring true. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eIf you’re in the “love him” camp, you might view this as a wonderful saga of our times. The modern day, green-conscious, gentrifying class (I believe “yuppie” is the antiquated term) is skillfully deconstructed. Generations are studied. Evolution is noted. And it is a big, sweeping book with a big, obvious theme (see title). Detractors, though, may have a point when they mention how confused the politics can seem. Son Joey might as well have worked for Halliburton, but that’s at odds with his previously avowed views and certainly with his upbringing. Walter is a conservationist, but becomes a sorely compromised one. And Patty’s family back east is from the limousine liberal school of thought, yet had a very unsupportive view when it came to a vital women’s issue (I won’t say what, but it rhymes with date crepe). You might conclude they were all a little naïve about the best and worst traits of their own chosen sides.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe big theme was mentioned often and explicitly. The conclusion is easy to summarize: Freedom isn’t always a good thing. You can be given enough rope to hang yourself. This is true for individuals as well as societies, and his examples, either personal or political, were meant to show this. To be honest, I don’t see Franzen at his insightful best when it comes to this issue. Who wouldn’t agree that freedom is good \u003ci\u003eup to the point it encroaches on toes\u003c/i\u003e? The crux of the biscuit comes in deciding where the line should be drawn. I also felt that the characters hurt by their own freedom of choice were pretty short-sighted, even borderline stupid at times. Fortunately, some were capable of learning from their mistakes. Discovering who comes around to a new way of thinking is one of the pleasures of the book because most of them needed to.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eI suspect the most telling critiques recognize what the literary establishment says is at stake. Is this truly an American classic? By those standards, I side with the arbiters of such things who look at the pillars of our American experience – individualism, consumerism, might as a proxy for right, and self-interest (which may teeter with self- loathing) – and distrust Franzen’s constructs to represent their abuses. I recognize buttheads in everyday life, including my own brand, but I just don’t see \u003ci\u003ehis\u003c/i\u003e type as being the real deal. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eIt occurs to me that my review may be as inconsistent as one of Franzen’s flawed characters. I’m saying I don’t much care for the core of what he says, but that he says it very well. That gets him three and a half equivocating stars, rounded to four – well short of Great American Novel status, but worth the effort to see what all the fuss is about.\u003cbr
