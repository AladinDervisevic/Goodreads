  <span id="freeText13421157410136288406" style="display:none">This is a brilliant anthology. It's a great chance to meet new authors and read books from authors you already love. Here's my reviews of a few books included in this anthology. <br /><br /><br />Royal Blood<br />This was a really fantastic read. I started this one evening and stayed up until Id finished it as its unputdownable. <br /><br />I love a good biker story. I also love dark reads so I was super excited to read this. <br />Mercy and X are the main characters. The attraction between them is instant. Mercy is a feisty character. She's got secrets and is on the run. X is dark and twisted. <br /><br />Be warned this is a dark read. If you like raw dark stories then this could be the book for you. This is the beginning of what looks like a very promising series. I'm so looking forward to reading more from this author about these characters.<br /><br />Angel Falling <br /><br />This is book one in this three part series. All the books in this series can be read as standalones. <br /><br />This is a really great read. Aspen and Hank are great main characters. Hanks a really sexy cowboy. When Hank saves Aspens life both their lives change. The chemistry between these two is brilliant. <br /><br />I found this to be a really intense rollercoaster of a story. Brilliant story that I highly recommend.<br /><br />Letting Go<br /><br />What a brilliant debut book this was.<br />Cassidy has been through a lot yet she's come out the other side smiling. James is the oh so hot millionaire playboy. This is their story. It's a totally hot book with lots of sex in it. I loved the storyline. Although the POV changed a lot I totally loved this book. It doesn't end in a cliff hanger but there is certainly more to their story. <br />Received in return for an honest review.<br /><br />Irrevocable<br /><br />Where do I start with this review? Can you just look in my head and see the jumble mess the author just left me in?? No ok I'll try and put into words what I thought. <br /><br />This book is what it says in the synopsis... Plus so much more. Its a really dark story that's gonna have you thinking 'what the hell am I reading'. I sat and read this in one sitting. It got under my skin. On several occasions I shaked my head thinking how can I seriously like reading this book. Yes it's that kinda book. <br /><br />This is a phenomenal written by a fantastic author.<br /><br />Warning: This isn't your rainbows and love sonnets kind of romance. This story explores topics of abduction and slavery, and contains explicit scenes of graphic violence and (non-con/dub-con) sex.<br /><br /></span>

Wether you have a romantic streak or you are a naughty reader - you will find it all in this one HOT package!<br />My favorite book in this collection has to be 'The Descendant' by Kelley Grealis!<br />I have a soft spot for this book, it is the first book I read and reviewed on my blog, Dowie's Place! <br />The beginning has a slow build that did seem to take a little longer than necessary to get through. For that reason, the start of the story was slightly difficult to relate to. However once it got going there was never a dull moment! We have a Biblical Based work of fiction that will not stop!<br />We find our heroine at an emotional crossroads searching for answers and fresh out of tragedy, she's suddenly thrown into a world she couldn't have possibly imagined. She seems to acclimate rather quickly, almost too quickly, and too soon we find the story has finished. I wanted more!!<br />I love the different take on the history of the siblings and vampirism. It's refreshing to read something different that still stays true to the genre yet can still be entertaining.<br />If you like a strong female lead, coming into her own while struggling to find her place, then this is most assuredly a good read.<br />All of these books are fantastic! If you are looking for betrayal stories, warrior, or something more on the naughty side- Indulgence is THE book - books ;) - for you!<br />~Dowie</span>

I was shocked at how much I actually enjoyed the cowboy read, as this isn't my usual but this anthology has taught me to broaden my horizons and embrace the cowboys! My to be read list has grown exponentially. A marvelous introduction to 15 wickedly talented authors that may have otherwise escaped my attention. This is one of the most perfect box sets I have. I really can't find the words do it justice! <br /><br />A five star aptly named anthology that everyone should read.</span>

If you're into contemporary romance, MC's, paranormal, dark romance, cowboys, BDSM. This anthology offers it all. Plus I was able to discover a few new authors who I will be following their work for more.<br />My favorite was The Descendant by Kelley Grealis it's the first part of the Descendant Vampire Series and I definitely want to read the rest of this series. Also this author is new to me, and I just love her writing style, and her take on the vampire is really something else, a totally unique twist on vampires. I was immersed into this story right away, it is just really gripping.<br />Royal Blood by Amity Cross was another one that just gripped on to me and wouldn't let go. This one is dark and a total hang on to your seat read. There's just so much good reading here. You just aren't going to find a better collection. You get more bang for your buck with this anthology, it's really a gift from these authors. I was given a complimentary copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.</span>

  <span id="freeText11429979124659705579" style="display:none">Fifteen amazingly hot stories all bundled up for us at a special price. What a treat! I spent hours reading these stories and I have to admit, I loved them. Here is my review of two of the stories just to give you an idea.<br /><br />Royal Blood (Royal Blood #1) by Amity Cross <br /><br />The warning from the author has to be reiterated. If you are looking for a sweet sentimental and rosy romance, this is not a book for you. This book is meant for readers who love to read about the darkness in our souls, the evil side we control and hide, the side that sometimes recognizes the underbelly of society exists and it is not pretty. All that said, that underbelly of society has some great stories to tell and if you can stomach it, you will be challenged, thrilled and will be emotionally impacted.<br /><br />Right from the start we know Mercy is running away from someone. She has dyed her hair to change her appearance, lost weight, and now has a tough exterior that says "do not f**k with me". All in all, she is still a beautiful woman, just unattainable. Working at a seedy bar owned by the motorcycle gang known as Royal Blood is about all she can do to keep herself alive. The pay is good and in cash. No social security numbers to give, no ID to flash, just do the job and survive.<br /><br />"X" is man few can look in the eye. He is a gorgeous man, but evil, danger, and death are projected vibes everyone feels when they are in the same room with him. He is the "hitman" for the gang, and no one messes with him. The fact that he is instantly attracted to Mercy just makes life complicated for both of them.<br /><br />Secrets abound in this story. This is the first book in this series. It is a gripping story of fear, death and survival. It is raw and without embellishment. Sometimes it takes a broken soul to recognize the darkness we have to deal with within ourselves. Maybe two broken souls can heal each other.<br /><br />"Darkness clung to my mind as I struggled to the surface, trying to drag me down. It would be so much easier to just give in."<br /><br />My Last Dom by Deanndra Hall<br /><br />This is a poignant story. Kimberly loved her husband and stood by him for years. Raised her son, took care of her home, and one day, her husband totally destroyed her world by walking out on her. It wasn't so much that he divorced her, it was that he crushed her spirit on his way out. Now she is errantly surviving without a Dom or a purpose. <br /><br />Jaz is also divorced his story is a bit different, but with the same consequences. He also carries with him a dark secret he cannot easily share with others. He also is existing and hoping to find a partner to his Dom ... a submissive who will also love and cherish him.<br /><br />This is their journey. For a D/s relationship to work, there must be trust and honesty. In Deandra Hall's consummate storytelling skills, she weaves us a story of despair and redemption. Forget what you think you know about this lifestyle. This is the story that best defines how unique the D/s relationship is. Each couple is its own world. Each couple controls the parameters of the relationship. <br />I love this story! Kim and Jaz deserve their HEA.</span>

  <span id="freeText12818919091179481380" style="display:none">A brilliant collection of full length novels by authors at the top of their game. Here's my review of one of the novels,Irrevocable, by Skye Callahan<br /><br />Freakin’ Brilliant! <br /><br />A freakingly brilliant read that kept me glued to my Kindle until the wee hours! I LOVE dark erotic reads and this ranks amongst one of the best I have read in a long time. Like others in the genre it contains explicit scenes of sex and violence (especially sexual violence) and is also deeply psychological as it examines the themes of domination, submission and sadism. It also contains a heart rending love story, hot love making, super erotic scenes and self-sacrifice. This particular dark read spotlights how far would you submit to survive and in doing so could you preserve your sense of self?<br /><br />The heroine ‘Silver’ (whose real name we only learn towards the end of the novel) is abducted and taken to a ‘retreat’ run by the twisted megalomaniac crime lord Ross, who dabbles in the pleasures afforded by slaves alongside other illegal activities. Silver finds herself in the hands of Kirk to be trained as a slave. She is left under no illusions as to her new role, to be his sexual toy for him or his sadistic boss Ross to use as they desire. She soon realises that her only way to survive is to submit to the pleasure and pain Kirk her ‘master’ subjects her to. Yet she constantly rebels against this as she fears that to do so she will break completely.<br /><br />Kirk is a conundrum to Silver and the reader, a cruel and harsh task master who is not pleased to find himself saddled with a difficult slave to train, but he will do what it takes to keep her in line, however painful it is. As they spend more time together however, Kirk occasionally reveals the existence of a softer side, but he will not deviate from his responsibility of training his slave. From this unequal relationship a strong bond develops between them, yet can Silver reconcile herself to her new role and can she survive in such a sadistic and violent environment which is overseen by Kirk’s boss Ross?<br /><br />I LOVED Silver and Kirk. Silver is strong and feisty despite enduring so much and Kirk is a hottie who appears to be a monster, yet is far less of a monster than others within the world she finds herself in. The scenes between Silver and Kirk are intense and downright hot, but at times had me in despair and reaching for the tissues!<br /><br />Aside from the hero and heroine, there are some other great characterisations, from the evil and sadistic Ross and Gabe to Miles, his second in command. Note to author – like other readers, I too would love to see Miles have his own book!<br /><br />I will not say any more but the novel has an inventive and well-paced roller coaster of a plot, with many surprises, including a great twist. Lovers of dark romances will certainly want to add it to their reading list! <br /><br />A copy of this novel was given to me for the purpose of a fair and honest review.<br /></span>

  <span id="freeText10651073673368653295" style="display:none">I received an ARC of this book for an honest review.<br /><br />I'm a big fan of anthologies because t’s usually a good way to discover new authors work and to get a lot of books for a really good price. Although there is always the possibility that some of the books are just meh. This anthology was good, lots of freaking hot stories with very interesting characters. A few of the books I did not quite like, or felt much of a pull to, but overall a fantastic offering.A few that were part of a series or the start of one which is good as a few of the stories had secondary characters I was interested in to discover what their lives held as well.<br /><br />Royal Blood by Amity Cross 4.5 stars<br /><br />The first book in the anthology and this really gripped me. The characters were strong and flawed, the writing was superb and I was l left thinking if all the books are like this then it’s a winner. Mercy is a woman on the run after the murder of her family. She finds herself changed after this and after attempting to get revenge, her fate is sealed. She walks into a bar for a job, and meets X. X is a man tormented, tortured to become the hit man of the Royal Blood MC. He’s determined to complete one last job, that will bring him enough money to get out. His job unfortunately bring him into direct contact with the woman behind the bar. <br />Mercy knows X is dangerous, but the attraction pulls and she dances with his fire until she finds herself into a tight situation. With everyone playing a game, and no one telling the truth when information comes to light that X needs, he will trust the the woman he’s taken will help him find those answers his mind cannot remember. Brilliant, dark and raw. <br /><br />Angel Falling by Audrey Carlan 4 stars<br /><br />Rich businesswoman and hot cowboy builder. What a great story. I was pleasantly surprised with this story. The characters were well written, the romance believable and the friendships funny and outrageous. Aspen and Hank really hit it off, even as they worried about how the relationship would progress once he has to leave her home after the accident that saves her life and his job on her building is complete. With family pressures around and friends , will Aspen give into her heart of her head?<br />A heart -warming steamy story that will keep you reading from beginning to end. I loved these characters, a vulnerable woman finds a man who’s strong enough to take her on. A tale that will leave you wanting more from the author. <br /><br />Escaping Me by Cat Mason 3.5 stars<br /><br />Daisy Shayne is a planner, she knows where her life is going. With summer approaching, her fiancée Landon asks her to accompany him on a tour with his brother’s band Shaft. Meeting the band is nothing like she expected especially when Grayson comes on to her, and he’s the fiancée brother. <br />It all goes to the dogs in less than a week when it seemed while Daisy was planning for one life, Landon has some mega secrets he’s been holding out on her. Not surprisingly she gets involved with Gayson, a bit quick in my book but hey it’s a book, and it’s a rock band. The other characters in here were funny, quirky. All about the sex, the bacon and the women. Grayson is a bit of a prick in the beginning , but rallies round when Daisy’s life goes to hell. He knows what he wants and goes after it no holds bared.<br /><br />Releasing Rage by Cynthia Sax 4 stars<br /><br />Gosh I loved this book. So much I read it more than once. I love a strong female lead, one who will give her all for her man and I loved Joan here. Joan, the singular female engineer on a battle station surrounded by sorry excuses for men; and the cyborgs that fight for humans in eradicating the Mantidae, an Alien life form. When she’s paired with a C model Cyborg, she’s overjoyed. She wanted to be paired with one since her rescue as a child, but when she meets Rage she realizes that the other engineers on the ship are actual scum and she realises how dangerous thy are as they consider the cyborgs to be non-feeling entities.<br />Rage is a cyborg who’s endured much, he’s been tortured by previous handlers. As a C model, he’s primitive as there are newer models that look human; whilst for him it’s obvious he’s not. He has the highest kill rate of all the cyborgs hunting the Mantidae for the humans. When Joan walks into his chambers claiming to be his new engineer, he doesn’t trust her and announces she will not last long as he will end up killing her as humans are all bad. But the more Joan treats him like he’s worth something and cares for him, he realises this female of his is a keeper. <br />This was very good and not wanting to give more away, I’ll say the writing was fantastic and the main characters were heart- warming, I loved the secondary cyborgs characters and found myself wondering If they will all have their HEA. So will be keeping an eye out for their stories as well.<br /><br />My Last Dom by Deandre Hall 5 stars<br /><br />I loved, absolutely loved this book. Kimmie’s suffering from a broken heart/spirit since her husband left her for a younger woman a few years ago, after confessing that he never loved her. This is especially hard as he was her Dom all this time, and this confession breaks her leaving her feeling worthless and in pain. She self-medicates by being a pain slut in the dungeon she visits. He friends tries to help but she doesn’t want it. When she meets Jaz, she connects to him immediately. A Dominant with a difference in her world. He makes her feel again and she makes him complete and understand his fears as well. <br />Once these two get together the chemistry is so explosive. It makes me want a man like him, I was practically throbbing when she was. The writing of this story was superb , it was like being there. I also loved that the characters were a bit older than the norm. A tale of the bonding process, the characters are human and struggles with their own fears and attempt to conquer them with each other. It’s not all roses as they were parts in there that were hard to read when there was regression.<br /><br />Perpetual Love by Jamie Salisbury 3 stars<br /><br />This one wasn’t really my cup of tea, but it was an okay story. It was good to see the lead female Anne being such a strong woman, as the timeframe this was based on this would have been unusual. I liked how these characters grew together, before getting together but that would have been common at that time too. The issues with her father and Joe young were the only bit that surprised me as those seemed to have been brushed aside, so it felt a bit incomplete.<br /><br />Letting Go, Anchored hearts by J.M Witt 3.5 stars<br /><br />I wasn’t sure how to take this one, it seemed a bit choppy. It starts with Cassidy and her friend Holly meeting at the bar with their respective boyfriends. When Cassidy man at the moment introduces her to James, she’s attracted to him but as she’s with Dan it’s not pursued. After a shoot- out at a bar and Holly dies, Cassidy is heart broken by her friend’s death. When her brother breaks the news that the owner of the bar was involved, it’s even more painful as James was the owner.<br />After they meet again, due to a little wrangling from James family at a party she’s organizing, the heat is still there and they get together. James is very take charge, and sometimes just a bit too much. Like when he has his people re-decorate her bedroom without her approval. It was interesting as the story is told from both POV, though sometimes they would be talking about the same event, but it seemed so different and it threw me off a few times. Very descriptive, and loads of music references which just annoyed me. A few silly sentences , and although she knows he’s rich and has money when they picture gets into the papers she gets a bit angsty. Again wanted to slap the silly out of both of them. <br /><br />The Descendant by Kelley Grealis 3.5 stars<br /><br />I was not expecting the story I got with this book. It seemed to start off one way then turned into something completely different . It required paying attention to get the story straight as well.<br />Allison is currently having a body crisis, having dreams of a garden that calms her, but throws the rest of her moods off. She’s suffering from hot flushes and cold sweats and the doctors can’t find anything wrong. Matt her husband is being very supportive of her and what she’s going through. When they get in an accident after a party one night, everything really gets strange as Allison wakes up and is now told t’s three years later and Matt is dead. She no longer lives where she was and has cut all her friends off, and now apparently has a new boyfriend Vincent.<br />It gets strange here on in, as Vincent reveals that she’s a descendant of the first Vampire and must either be turned or killed. A bit of biblical and paranormal twist to throw this story into another realm. When she’s turned against her will, and it’s revealed to her Matt is alive. Allison decides it’s time to take a step away and discover what and who’s being honest with her.<br />The writing is good, story moves at a good pace, but it takes a while to get into it.<br /><br />Rescued, Three’s allowed by Laura Harner 4 stars<br /><br />I loved this book. When Graeme is awakened to go check out a domestic at a gas station, the last thing he expects is to find the woman who he pushed into another mans’ arms years ago. Elizabeth Ashford has a crazy husband after her, when she escapes him at a rest room and a stranger tries to help her she never expect to come face to face with the man she’s always loved. Michael Enwright tries to do a good deed and gets his car totalled and shot up. <br />When Graeme offers his house as protection for Lizzie, Michael tags along as he’s into security and has made a connection with the woman he’s saved. When these three get together, a few home truths come out and they all fall in love. But it’s not all roses as Lizzie crazy husband tries to ensure if he doesn’t have her no one will. The characters in this were great, attraction between them is honest and although it’s almost like instalove, there is a back story to Lizzie and Graeme so this worked well.<br /><br />Man On (Black Jack gentlemen) by Liz Crowe 3.5 stars<br /><br />A story of one man discovering himself and an older one trying to convince himself he’s worthy of change and second chances. This book is set in the world of sports, Nicco is bisexual but has been outed as gay by his ex-wife, so his soccer career is basically over in Europe. He moves to America as part of the Black Jacks a trial squad. He meets young Parker, a man who’s recently gotten out from under his parents thumb and they intentions for him to go to college, marry a nice girl and produce the requisite 2.5kids. He rebels, joins the football world and after setting eyes on Nicco he realises that although he likes the ladies, he has a thing for guys. After an incident at a club, they resort to keeping up appearances until Nicco decides he wants change and, when the two eventually get together the sparks fly. <br />The pace of the story was good, and the POV was from both men as well as from Rafe, the Co-manager of the team. This was a bit different, but it did give us a wider view of what the team was about. I was only unhappy as the time flipped so fast, it seemed we missed the relationship growing. The author did a good job of portraying what athletes who do come out have to face and the personal devils that sometimes haunt them. <br /><br />Relent, Sydney Storm MC by Nina Levine 4 stars<br /><br />A new MC series by Nina Levine, this book features Evie and Kick. Kick is a member of the MC Storm, he got into the club as a young man, and they have been like family to him. He’s done some bad things for his Pres and the club. Due to where he is, he gave up on Evie the woman he still loves. These two grew up together and Kick was always there for Evie until three years ago when they were in a relationship and he walked away because of something that was said by a mutual friend.<br />After the death of the part 3 of their friendship, Evie and Kick connect again. She knows he’s done things in the club he’s not proud of, but she also knows that she still loves this man and he completes a part of her that no one has been able to. Second chances at love story, the characters are fleshed out and it was easy to get involved in their story and see where the relationship was going to go and end up. Loved it<br />A good story, there is a lot of interplay between the members of the clubs and the various family members of both Kick and Evie. It makes you wonder about what their individual stories are. The chemistry between these two is hot, the sex scenes are amazing and I want to know where the handcuffs went. <br /><br />Make mine a Cowboy by Sandy Sullivan 3.5 stars<br /><br />A really feel good cowboy romance story. The story of the author who goes to a romance book conference only to fall in love with her very own cowboy. Mesa is an author who’s currently having a slump in her writing, when she goes to a book conference and goes for a drive, she never expects to be stranded and rescued by her very own cowboy. Not only that there’s three of them identical. But she’s only got eyes for Joel.<br />Joel is one of the nine Young brothers, one of the triplets. These boys are hot, hard bodied and very individual. He’s interested in Mesa, but is convinced this will just be a brief affair as she stays on their dude ranch whilst doing some hands on research. Unfortunately the heart wants what the heart wants, and he quickly discovers that he wants her forever. <br />Loved this book and I’m looking forward to seeing the rest of the brothers books.<br /><br />Seal under Covers by Sharon Hamilton 3.5 stars<br /><br />I loved Military stories, and SEALS get me hot. This is the third book in the series, so wasn’t sure if I would miss out on some back story but this held up as a standalone, they were some references to stuff that happened previously, but nothing so great that you felt you missed much. I wanted this book to be so much better, so I was a little disappointed that it didn’t grab me as I was hoping for. I didn’t get into the characters that much and sometimes it felt a bit flat. <br />Gina is an undercover cop trying to get information to put Carlos, the Scorpions leader behind bars, to do this she’s using Mia Guzman to get close. As the female undercover agent, the team she’s working with includes her ex Sam- not good news for her as he wants to get back with her and she wants him gone. Gina seems a little lost in this story, I don’t get much from her character and I found myself just thinking she’s quite bland. The author tries but she didn't resound with me as a detective who should be undercover.<br />Armando is Mia’s big brother and a member of the SEALS. He comes back from training only to find his sister is back with the bad news guys. He is a character that was a bit fleshed out, there was more to him. He has a thing for Gina, but is certain she’s lying to him, but he never finds out what until the very end. He and Gina get together, and the sex scenes are great, so big plus here. <br />Didn't enjoy this as much as I wanted unfortunately.<br /><br />Irrevocable by Skye Callahan 4.5 stars<br /><br />A dark and gritty read that pulls at the gut. This book may be a trigger for some readers, so caution to be taken with this read. <br />Awakening in hell, a woman becomes Silver. Not sure how she got there, she taken from a situation between five men to just one who will own her body and soul. She’s handed over like a dog to a man she must call master, if she wants to survive, but now she’s told she needs to forget her old life and be what she is now- a slave.<br />A strong character, Silver will not break. She fights to retain herself even when she is raped repeatedly, and assaulted. She should be broken like all the other girls in the situation, but she’s not. <br />Kirk, the man she’s given to. At the beginning I hated his character, but he changed my opinion of him as the story goes on. It’s hard to say much without giving away the story here, but suffice to say,there were some twists in this book I didn't see coming.<br />The characters in this book were all fleshed out, and evoked emotions in me that made me stop reading at points and just breathe to continue. A good read, with all the requisite darkness you would expect to find in this type of book<br /><br />A Special Connection by Theresa Troutman 4 stars<br /><br />New Adult story of first loves and first times. A sweet emotional story of best friends who discover their love for each other. Jake, Rick and Samantha are best friends . Samantha and Rick are a couple, Sam is the brain, whilst Rick is the budding sport star. Jake is the storyteller here, and he’s had it bad. An accident that killed his parents and damages his leg, has left him certain no woman will be interested in him. When a kiss from Sam has him thinking, maybe the love he feels for her isn't just as a friend but perhaps more. This is one of the least steamy books in the anthology, but the scenes we do get are well written. This is a book that stays with you.<br /></span>

This anthology has 15 full length stories with something for everyone from Cowboys to Bikers, Vampires and more. These are the reviews for my favorite books in the collection.<br /><br />Amity Cross Royal Blood (Royal Blood #1)<br /><br />I really enjoyed this book although it was kind of and MC book it was kind of not. The MC part of the story wasn’t the focus of the story, the search for X’s mark and Mercy’s past are the main focus of the story with the MC theme around the edge which I really liked. The book ends on a cliffhanger so i’m excited to find out what happens to the couple in the next book.<br /><br />Audrey Carlan Angel Falling (Falling #1)<br /><br />Loved the story! Loved Hank and Aspen. Hank seriously makes me want to go searching for guys in Texas! Hihi, Aspen was so sweet though I’m glad she loosened up by the end of the book. I’m glad he fought for her and that Aspen’s friend were on her side. A really great romance that proves that no matter where you come from love trumps all.<br /><br />Cynthia Sax Releasing Rage<br /><br />I LOVED this book! This was my first cyborg book and it was amazing. I loved the characters the plot everything! There was an equal amount of plot and naughty goodness which I loved. Rage and Joan are awesome I’m amazed I liked her with a name like Joan seems an odd choice for the h’s name but it works it describes her character perfectly and Rage’s name is so cool and also fits his personality. Really good book.<br /><br />Deanndra Hall My Last Dom<br /><br />This book was great! Both of the main characters have had bad past relationships and struggle to find someone they can trust. There is a lot of things going on in this story and you’ll be hooked from the start. There’s great sex and the story makes you want to keep reading to find out what will happen to the new couple. There is a moment where things look bleak but then they managed to turn out well.<br /><br />Laura Harner Rescued (Three’s allowed 2)<br /><br />I really enjoyed this book. It was emotional and sexy. The characters were perfect for each other and I love that they had to find out who they were as people before jumping into a relationship together. The action was great the sex hot and the story was great.<br /><br />Skye Callahan Irrevocable (Irrevocable 1)<br /><br />This book was great! I wasn’t sure what to expect but if you like a dark read this is the story for you. I won’t say anything because I don’t want to spoil the story but it was really good and the characters are awesome. I felt for Silver from the beginning and at first I hated Kirk but near the end of the book he started to grow on me and his actions in the beginning of the book became clear. A very good story that I really enjoyed and will have to read the sequel.<br /><br />Theresa Troutman A special Connection<br /><br />It’s hard to put into words what this story is about but if I had to try I’d say it’s a story about love and lose and finding your forever with someone that’s made for you. A really nice story.<br /><br /> </span>

  <span id="freeText16686258791013018273" style="display:none">Royal Blood- by Amity Cross<br />I love a dark story, and I haven't found anything too dark for me.

The characters are dark, the setting is rough, it is exactly what is says it is going to be. Now I want to read more of this series!<br />Mercy is on the run. After tragedy strikes her family, she is the only one who can get justice. When she tries, things don't go as planned and she has to run. Unfortunately, her target wants her taken out. Her salvation may just be the worst place she could have run to. Staying on the razor's edge changes her. She might not be alone after all.<br />X(avier Blood) is a hit man for a MC and he is one of the best. But he has other plans. Little does he know that he might not be getting the bargain he is hoping for. And when he meets the brash bartender that was hired, his life might be changing. Good or bad, he is going down this path no matter what.<br />And the ending! Oh, man, my heart was pounding. This book is great because these characters are dynamic, complicated. You end up rooting for characters that aren't all good or all bad. It is a gripping story line of revenge and justice, street style. I love a book that makes no apologies, and this is it. I am eager to read on.<br />Angel Falling-by Audrey Carlan<br />I started reading this series on book two, so when I went back to the beginning with this book, I could see how things began. I have fallen in love with this series. It is full of sexy alpha men, strong, beautiful women, and a great story line. Who needs more? It is impossible to not fall in love with this cast of characters. From the obscenely wealthy socialite, the quirky gay couple, to the all american cowboy, there is something for everyone.<br />Aspen Reynolds is a twenty something, very successful businesswoman who knows how to build an empire. She is wildly beautiful, all blonde haired and fair eyes. She runs her empire with help from her assistant, and best friend Oliver. Oliver is an adorable gay man who keeps Aspen's world running smoothly. He takes care of every detail in her life, right down to her hair. She also has a sexy sister named London, who is an interior decorator/ life coach.<br />Hank Jensen is an all american, Texas cowboy. He owns a construction company that is doing work on Aspen's building. He is a true southern gentleman who loves his momma and his family. He is an honest businessman that takes pride in his work.<br />Aspen is expanding on her building. She is doing so well that she hires Hank's company to do the expansion. Being a very busy lady, she doesn't notice what is happening while she is standing outside her building. But Hank sees it. When the pipes come loose from the crane, he notices a beautiful woman standing directly below it. He dives at her to get her out of the way. The pipe goes through his shoulder, but the angel in white is safe. Waking up in the hospital, he is blown away by her beauty. She wants to do anything to help the man who saved her. She moves him into her penthouse and nurses him back to health. Hank is quickly falling for her, and things move on from there. But can a cowboy from Texas and a New York socialite ever have anything in common? With the two of them living so far apart be able to make it work? What will happen when she goes to Texas to his ranch? Could their pasts come back to haunt them?<br />This story is so wonderfully written, the characters so unique and well developed, that I was hooked from the very beginning. And the quirky Oliver and his mate Dean are so adorable, you cannot help but fall in love with them. This is an amazing love story too good to be missed. Grab a copy and get ready to fall in love with this series. I know I did!<br />Escaping Me- by Cat Mason<br />I liked this book pretty well. It is definitely different than I was expecting, and that is some of the reason that I liked it so much. The main character is faced with quite a few challenges, and how she reacts is what did it for me. I wasn't expecting her to do the things she did. To me, that is a favorite thing of mine. It is no fun to know where the story is headed. I love surprises and this book delivered that very well.<br />Daisy lives her life by rigid lists. She has her plan for the next 5 years. She is going to marry Landon and they will be middle class american dream, or so she thinks. But first, they are going to tour with his brother's bad for a bit. Landon has a new job with them, working under Tad. When Grayson, Landon's brother, meets Daisy at the club, their whole universe flips on its side. Grayson is sex and sin, hot as can be. Daisy knows she has to be careful, she wants him. And it looks like he feels the same. When things don't add up on the tour, Daisy has some choices to make; Stay on her plan that she believes is possible, or follow her heart? But things are not what they seem, and everything shifts.<br />This book will take you on a ride you don't see coming. And it is such a great trip. I loved the creative way the author weaved this complicated situation. This book is hot and sexy an unpredictable. Definitely worth checking out.<br />Releasing Rage- by Cynthia Sax<br />First, I have to say that I usually shy away from futuristic books. But I loved this one. I have reread it 3 times in a row. There is something about this book that just grabbed me and wouldn't let go. The characters are fantastic and the story gets under your skin. You could see something like this happening. The fight in these characters just grips you and you feel yourself rooting out loud that they should win. The bad guys are great bad guys. They are the kind that fuels your anger. I found my emotions going all over the place with this book. That's how I know it is a great book to me.<br />Joan Tull is the only female engineer on a battle station full of men and cyborgs. She has no family at all, and zero support around her. Her life has always been tough. The only bright spot is her memory of a cyborg saving her as a little girl. Because of that, she has worked hard to get to where she is at. She wants to pay it forward to the cyborgs that defend humans against giant bug-like creatures. When she gets the call to become an engineer of her own cyborg, she is thrilled. She has survived countless attacks from the men on the station and all of their taunts and name calling, but now she was getting her dream come true.<br />Rage is a C class cyborg. He is intimidating, big, and rougher than the new models. His skin is grey and he doesn't blend in with humans like the newer models. After enduring torture at the hands of his engineers and other members of the Human Alliance, he slaughters his handler. No one will experiment and cruelly torture him for their sick pleasure. He realizes that his action will mean his death, but he will take as many as he can with him. When he is assigned Joan, he has had it. He is going to show them that he is stronger and smarter and if she tries to hurt him, he will end her.<br />When she turns submissive to him and is attracted to him of her own free will, something changes in Rage. Joan is surprised by her own attraction to this rough cyborg too. But together, they might just find a way to heal each other and save the cyborgs. That is if the men don't kill Joan first.<br />This book has an incredible story and a perfect ending. I loved it from page one and that shocked even me. I will have to go check out more from this author, because I am hooked now! If you love sexy stories with a great story line and characters you can believe in, check this one out!<br /><br />My Last Dom- by Deanndra Hall<br />Oh my gosh, where to start? Deanndra Hall has set the bar for a true and honest look into the BDSM lifestyle. This book is a must read if you want to understand how there is no one way in this community. And, this is a beautifully written tale of love and loss and sorrow and fear and redemption. All wrapped up perfectly between the pages. This is a complicated tale of a love affair forged through pain and heart ache, but it is uplifting and sexy and wonderful. The characters are deep, you believe they could exist. It is just a great story that needs to be experienced.<br />Kimberly Hendricks thought she had it all. A husband, a child they raised, a good job making leather clothes and corsets, a Dom of her own-until her husband tore her world apart from the inside out when he left her and reveals that he never loved her and didn't think he could do any better. She spirals into a very dark place where she can only find peace through pain inflicted by sadistic Doms. When even her health is in peril, her only friends try to help.<br />Jasper is a Dominant who specializes in restraint and kinbaku. He doesn't really lean towards sadism. He is a gentle soul who has been emasculated by his crazy ex wife after a horrible incident. He has healed, but their are still scars on the inside. He has so much love and caring inside. He wants to be loved, but he is cautious. When he meets Kimmie, he really thinks there might be something there. <br />When things get a bit strange, will they be able to weather the storm and come out the other side? Or can words and actions have such an impact that there is no way to heal the rift, despite the love? This book gets under your skin. It is a powerful lesson about trust and faith. And it is a beautiful love story about two very damaged souls and their journey to find themselves again.<br />Perpetual Love- by <br />I generally like historical romance, and this book was pretty good. It did lack the depth in the story line that I am used to in this genre, but for a shorter story, it is a decent read. It is set in the Nevada Territory, and the story line is interesting. The characters are interesting, and the romance is cute.<br />Albert Stuart is the son of a well-to-do rancher. He is college educated and is feeling like he wants to leave Nevada and do more with his life. And he will after he helps an old friend of his father's, by showing the daughter of the Judge around while they are here looking into moving to the area. He did not plan to fall in love. If he can keep his brothers away from her.<br />Anne Wallace doesn't know the real reason her father wants to move to this area of Nevada. It is just the two of them since her mother had died. She was raised in England, spending her favorite time with her grandfather. But her father doesn't care for him, so here they are. She was not expecting to fall for the man who was tasked with showing her around.<br />Their love affair blossoms quickly, but Anne is in for a rude awakening when it comes to her father, the judge. His agenda may just ruin everything. This story has some twists and turns that will raise your pulse. It is a good story about love and adventure and greed. If you like westerns, you may like this one.<br />Letting Go, Anchored Hearts, Vol. 1- by J.M. Witt<br />I guess this is a 3.5 book for me. It is decent read, and very sexy. The story is interesting enough to keep you turning the pages and the heat is there. Cassidy Charles meets the owner of a club while dating Dan, who's band plays there. James instantly has a connection with her, but when there is a shooting, Cassidy retreats. When they are thrust together again, Cassidy is hot for James, but questions his involvement in Dan's shooting. They are on fire together, but they both have baggage. Not to mention, family members interfere a bit as well. They are from different worlds and that creates tension. Their make-up sex is off the charts. A blast from the past is determined to interfere, and Cassidy has to search her heart to figure out who she trusts. Their back and forth romance isn't bad, it is just that this story line has been done a few times. It is a decent read if you love a bit of intrigue and very hot sex scenes. It just didn't blow me away.<br />The Descendant, The Descendant Vampire Series, book 1 by Kelley Grealis<br />I usually love paranormal books, especially vampires. This book just didn't do it for me. The story line was slow and awkward, and I couldn't get into the characters. The back story of these vampires is what drew me in. There is a group of vampires that has protected Allison's ancestors since the beginning. They are the mortal descendants of the first vampire. After a car accident, Allison's world flips on its head. Her husband has been dead for a while and she can't remember the last 3 years, so she thinks. She also cannot recall her boyfriend, Vincent Drake. Vincent has watched over her family and now Allison is the first mortal to exhibit vampire traits. She is the special one and he and his family will protect her from the other vampires who want her dead as a punishment. She is thrust into a different world when things go bad and she doesn't know who to believe. Everyone is lying to her. The premise is great, but the whole book barely moves the story along and I found myself not able to connect with the characters. I just didn't care what happened after a point. I don't know if the series improves, but I don't think I will find out. I like a faster story, I guess.<br />Rescued, Three's Allowed: book 2 by Laura Harner<br />This story is HOT. I really liked it. It is a short book, but the story is interesting and it has its twists and turns. The characters are interesting, the bad guy is very bad, and the three of them together is worth the time. They are sexy, yet there is a good story happening with their sexy scenes.<br />Elizabeth Ashford has reached her limits. Her husband started out ok, but after a few tours overseas in the middle east, he has changed into a monster. After beating her and chaining her to the house, he decides to take her to his cabin, where he can inflict a lot of harm to "teach" his wife to be faithful. He believes she is cheating on him with her boss, but he took care of that. At a rest stop, she flees, but he sees her and gives chase. Michael Enwright is a self made man who owns his own security firm. After working tirelessly for years, he decides to take a sabbatical. When he pulls into a rest stop, he sees a woman running from a man and tries to help. After scaring off her attacker and losing his car in the process, he gets manhandled by the Sheriff, Graeme Kennedy. Graeme Kennedy grew up with Elizabeth, but they lost touch after a while. They had dated and loved each other, but the Sheriff had secrets that he felt weren't fair to Elizabeth, so he encouraged her to date Barry, their friend. When he deployed after marrying her, Graeme moved away. Now thrown together, the heat is there and they both want Michael. Michael had never been attracted to men before, but there was something about the Sheriff that revved his motor. Was it possible to experience a love and bond with three people? Could they even go there with the bigger issue hanging over them? Or will the bad guy ruin everything?<br />This book has suspense, heat, sexiness off the charts, and more in the pages. it is definitely a reread book for me. Loved it!<br />Man On, Black Jack Gentlemen, book 1- by Liz Crowe<br />I think this is my favorite of Liz Crowe's books. This one had a bit of everything in it for me. The start up of the soccer team is interesting, the love story is complicated, and the various characters are fun. It is not a cut and dried love story. Both main characters have a lot of baggage, and they struggle to be what the other one needs. It is kind of like real life. Things rarely go smoothly. If you are a fan of the author, you will like this one. It is very true to her style of writing. You can easily identify the other by the layers to the story line.<br />Nicolas Garza is a superstar. He has the talent, but it is his sex life and partying that brings him down. He is an equal opportunity lover, and his stories are legendary. The wildness was calmed for a while, but when he loses the love of his life shortly after they have a big fight, he is a bit of a wild card.<br />Parker Rollings is an all-american kind of soccer star. He comes from money, his family has his life planned out, and he is supposed to marry his girlfriend and be a doctor. But he wants to play soccer. Plus, he is realizing that he might be gay. But he can't go there if he wants to play soccer.<br />When those two come together on the field in Detroit, there is an instant attraction. They are fighting for the same spot on the team, and Nicco is not about to give in. After a night out, Parker is more confused then ever, but the attraction is hot under the surface. Throw in a PR department that wants Nicco as the poster boy for gay players and a surprising off season trip, and you have fireworks. But things go from great to bad in a flash back in the motor city. Can these two sexy stars find a way towards happily ever after, or is it just a pipe dream? Can two men who are so different find a way to be together? There is so much going on in the book, you won't want to put it down.<br />Relent, Sydney Storm MC, book 1- by Nina Levine<br />This is a pretty good tale of soulmates. But that doesn't mean it is easy or without heartache. These characters have always loved each other, but for one reason or another, they have tried to be together twice before, and it didn't go well. Evie has always loved Kick. He was there for her when scandal ripped their world apart. Along with their friend Jeremy. But Kick was headed down a darker path as part of a MC. Jeremy convinced him that if he really loved her, he wouldn't drag her down in his trouble. So he walked away. Evie was done. A few years later, tragedy strikes her world and wrenches her happiness away. When she and Kick are reunited at the funeral, the sparks are still there. But, can they do this dance again? Or will it finally destroy Evie? Yeah, Kick is a criminal, but he isn't all bad. He has always tried to protect Evie, but he doesn't have the strength to ignore the love of his life. With the deck stacked against them, can they find a way to be together in the face of all the crap in their world? Are they meant to be, or is this the last dance for both of them?<br />Their love story has plenty of twists to keep you entertained. I thought it was a decent read with a very sexy bad boy. Curious about the next book in the series, because I like it hot.<br />Make Mine a Cowboy, Cowboy Dreamin' 1- by Sandy Sullivan<br />This is the first book of Sandy's that I have read. I really liked the story and the characters, and I can't wait to read more. This is a good ol' cowboy love story. You need those sometimes. The pace was good and the cowboy is sexy as ever. <br />Mesa is a romance writer at a conference in San Antonio. She lives in LA, where her family is. When she decides to go for a drive, she has no idea that the thunderstorm she gets caught in might just change her life. Joel is from a big family. He has tons of brothers and is one of a triplet. His family has a big ranch that also houses a dude ranch right with the working ranch. He is a handsome man who does well with the ladies, but he hasn't found the one. While riding the fences in the rain, he comes upon a woman in a flooded roadway, stranded. He rescues her and brings her to the ranch. She fits in well with the family, even though she is a city gal. Joel is smitten from the get go, and Mesa is right with him. But is it enough to bring them together? Seeing how she lives so far from there. They heat up the sheets, and their adventures on the farm keep it interesting. Will one of them find the strength to go after what they want? Or is it just a short fling that doesn't mean anything?<br />This book will make you want your own cowboy. He is every inch the gentleman, and she is a feisty Cali girl who knows how to heat it up. <br />To see the rest of my reviews for the books in the anthology, please check the individual books' reviews. This review has taken all the space it can. Great anthology, and such a bargain!<br /><br /></span>

  <span id="freeText8577273826058537559" style="display:none">Reviewed for Seraphim book for reviews. <br />3.5 stars overall for anthology, for individual ratings, please see blog.<br /><br />Royal Blood - Amity Cross<br />Xavier is a man that doesn't feel. He's a cold hard killing machine thanks to the life he has led with the Royal Blood MC. Until he meets Mercy, Mercy makes him feel, like he's never felt before. Bad stuff has happened to Mercy and she is running from it. Head first into a monster. Can the monster humanise himself and help Mercy. Can Mercy see past the evil and see the man?<br />There is so much going on in this book, yeah it's dark and in some places it's downright vulgar. If you can handle deep dark and nasty, this might just be the book for you. Yeah it's and MC, but not as you know it. <br />I thought I swore a lot, but Jeez, Amity loves to swear in here. The re are SOOO many "f***s" I found myself wanting to light some incense and calm myself down.<br /><br />Angel Falling - Audrey Carlan<br />Hank is a southern Gentleman, Aspen is a New York career girl. Their effect on each other is both charming and funny. Hank Saves Aspens life one day after an accident and sparks instantly fly. Their attraction is huge, its romantic, its steamy but it is difficult. They're very different people from very different worlds. Can they make it work or will their differences be what keeps them apart<br />Who doesn't love a cheeky page turner! Sexy, Funny and a HEA to melt even the coldest of hearts!<br /><br /><br />Escaping Me - Cat Mason<br />Daisy is a planner. A list maker. So am I, so I already loved this woman before anything even happened! She has a plan for her life, and that plan did not include falling for her brother in law to be. <br />Greyson is the lead guitarist for new band Shaft, he's about to tour and his brother Landon is along for the ride, with his missus Daisy, who Greyson takes one look at and he wants her. Obviously being an engaged woman, nothing can happen between them. Something is off with Landon though, he's distant and different and we've no clue why, until all is revealed and BAM and I didn't see that coming! Full of twists, full of sexy. Full of characters I can't wait to read more about.<br /><br /><br />Releasing Rage - Cynthia Sax<br />Joan was once saved by cyborgs, so when her dream of one day helping them and returning the favour comes true, she is thrilled. though her woman hating boss isn't happy about it, he has no choice but to send her to engineer on a battle station.<br />Once there she meets cyborg Rage, he's all angry and kill, kill kill. Joan wants none of that, she wants to help him. He's not had it easy. Aside from the whole kill, mame, destroy thing, he has been forced to breed with both humans and cyborgs. All in all he's not a happy cyborg. Can Joan fix that? Can she make him trust her. And how is it even possible that this cyborg has feelings, wants and needs? And who knew a cyborg could be so sexy???<br /><br /><br />My Last Dom - Deanndra Hall<br />A D/s story that's different. <br />In order for a D/s relationship to work, a couple needs trust and that's something that both Kim and Jaz struggle to do. They've both been left broken even shattered by a previous partner. Re building their lives has been difficult, but Kim needs a Dom and Jaz needs a sub. Can these two broken souls repair each other enough to provide what the other needs?<br />I'm not a great lover of BDSM books, so I can't say whether rules were followed correctly etc, but I can say I did enjoy reading this. It felt different. It felt to me, painful, but with a purpose and the more I read, the more I just wanted some happy.<br /><br /><br />Perpetual Love - Jamie Salisbury<br />Perpetual love is a historical style romance that tells the story of Anne and Albert. Two polar opposites who are even from opposite ends of the world, who are trying to forge a relationship together against the wishes of Anne's father.<br />Anne is stubborn and opinionated which is not so accepted at the time, but of course this only endears her to Albert. Not that he's a doormat, he has opinions of his own! His family are probably the most entertaining thing in the book. It felt like their was more chemistry between them, than there was between Anne and Albert. Honestly, this was difficult to finish. I didn't connect with the characters or the story and it all became hard work. Just not my cup of tea.<br /><br />Letting Go - J.M Witt<br />Cassidy and James are a young sexy couple, who spend a lot of time, being young and sexy! Sound odd? Yeah I know, but there really was a lot of it. I'm all for steamy sex scenes, but there were a lot of them. Too many for me. So Cassidy is just to beautiful for him to believe and James is you regular loaded handsome playboy. The come together (not for the first time)and theyre all sexy and beautiful, but they have pasts. Pasts that continue to bother them and leave their insecurities difficult for them to bare. <br />The switches between POV's can be difficult to grasp, but stick with it, once you get your head around it, it's fine. There is some BDSM, but for a none BDSM reader it was just the right amount for me to handle. No cliff hanger but plenty of what's going to happen there and other such questions to make you want to read the next book.<br /><br /><br />The Descendant - Kelley Grealis<br />Allison is missing 3 years of her life. After a horrific car accident that killed her husband, the tree years of memory have just gone. The people around her tell her her husband has been long since dead and she is now with this super handsome guy named Vincent. Super handsome vincent leads her along this path he is weaving and Allison follows along blindly (that kinda irritated me) but obviously we know this is a vampire story, and so we find out who the vampire descendant is. I won't reveal it, but I will tell you it isn't Super handsome vincent (who I would have put money on it being).<br />The story In my view can be split in two. Oldie worldie and present. The present day stuff I enjoyed, the old stuff not so much, but the two are woven seamlessly and for that i've gotta give the author credit.<br /><br /><br />Rescued - Laura Harner<br />Lizzie is on the run. Her husband beats her and she's had enough so she legs it. During her escape she runs into a sexy rich guy Michael who tries to help her, but his help is misinterpreted by the local Sheriff Graeme. The whole thing is sorted out and Graeme takes them to his secluded cabin in the woods. There are all kinds of sparks flying and its not long before sexy stuff happens between the three of them. Yeah it's hard to grasp how a woman who has literally just run from an abusive bastard, can't suddenly trust these two men and throw herself into this passionate affair but hey, its fiction. It would be a boring book if it all ended there though. Bastard husband has to be faced and some serious shit goes down that changes things drastically.<br />If your into threeways / MMF then this book could really tick a box for you. the sex is hot, really hot. I even enjoyed it, and that's really not my usual cup of tea!<br /><br /><br />Man On - Liz Crowe<br />Nicco is a spoilt brat football (soccer) player who is leaving his troubles in Europe behind and heading for the USA. Parker is an insecure college kid, who is all "Oh the pressure" when his parents want him to build a career for himself outside of football. These two clash when they are both after the same spot on the team, and the whole whiny angsty thing really annoyed me. But obviously they get over it and get it on!! It's not easy coming together and tensions are still high, coz yano, innocent and not so innocent. Open / in the closet. It's all a bit messy. And I REALLY don't see the point if this Rafe guy, but assuming this is all set up with a purpose for a future book.<br />All in all it was an enjoyable read for on the train, but there were too many bits that annoyed me to make me want to read a second book. <br /><br /><br />Relent - Nina Levine<br />So we meet the Sydney Storm boys at last! And Kick, Sweet &amp; Sour. Hot &amp; Cold, Right and Wrong, Kick. And his beautiful Evie.<br />They're perfectly imperfect. He's got his issues, she has her issues, they've both experienced the same loss and so they balance each other out. <br />He's all "Babe" and She's all "No" but then he's all "babe" and she's all "babe" But in a really good way!<br />Their history could either work for them or against them. It has the potential to blow up and ruin them both. Can they see out their issues and stick together or do they take the easy way out and walk away.<br />And its not very often I say this, but I even enjoyed the secondary characters. They were all cool (Except for his Mam, she's a wrong un).<br /><br /><br /><br />Make Mine A Cowboy - Sandy Sullivan<br />Cowboy Joel and city girl Mesa, meet on a backroad when Mesa is stranded. In typical cowboy fashion he saves the day by rescuing her. Having spent her career writing about cowboys, Mesa is in a situation she has fictionally dreamed of for a long time and just like in a good romance novel. Sparks fly instantly!<br />Joel takes Mesa to his ranch where he has a whole bunch of sexy cowboy brothers (If I was a girl who liked cowboys, Id be swooning at that bit)<br />They get all sexy together (and he's a bit of a dom in the bedroom so the sex scenes get intense) They laugh, they fight and they build something together, until her time staying at the ranch comes to an end. Will either of them man up enough to tell the other about the feels?<br /><br /><br />Seal Under Covers - Sharon Hamilton<br />A sort of military romance, mixed with police drama mixed with just some crazy people.<br />Armando a Navy Seal, falls for undercover police officer Gina. Armando is trying to sort his sister Mia's shit out (coz she's into the whole drug world) . Gina whilst under cover has befriended Mia and neither Mia or Armando know she is police.<br />It all starts unraveling when there is this great attraction between Armando and Gina, and Gina's abusive ex has stalker tendencies that are getting in the way. He is another detective.<br />Things all come to a head. It messy, its dirty and someone loses BIG TIME! But who, you gotta read to find out. <br />I did enjoy this, it was paced just right, it was dramatic enough to keep me reading but hot enough to tick a whole load of boxes. The one thing I would say is that Maybe Gina is in the wrong career. For a woman "determined to prove herself in a man's world" She can't seem to shut her legs and keep herself to herself. First a fellow detective and now a suspect's brother. Sheesh lady!<br /><br /><br />Irrevocable - Skye Callahan<br />A dark and dirty tale about Silver. A girl whose life is turned inside out and upside down when she is saved by a guy who only saved her for his own good. Kirk. He has a purpose for Silver and the purpose is him. The develop this strange relationship which is as weird and fucked up as it is interesting and addictive to read. The light in "Silver" never fully goes out, there is still a spark of life left in her that really should be after all she's been through, but with the unique partnership they have, that little bit of light works.<br />This is a shifty tale. It's erotic and sexy when it really shouldn't be. Its deep and dark and dangerous and incredibly addictive. I wanted to read more, the more messed up it got. And that kirk. What is it they say about onions and layers?<br /><br /><br />A Special Connection - Theresa Troutman<br /> A story about friendship, love and changes. Jake who has been crippled by an accident, feels unworthy of most things. He has two supportive lifelong friends Sam and Rick who are with him every step of the way. Sam and Rick start dating late in high school and the dynamic starts to change leaving Jake feeling confused. He's stuck between them when they fight and like any good friend doesn't want to pick sides, but he has a secret he has feelings for Sam. He's sort of in a relationship with Jenna, Rick's brother but that does not stop Rick Jake and Sam having a threesome. Obviously like most high school romances they all grow up and grow apart. thats life. The group dynamic changes. Relationships change. Thats life.<br />This felt really juvenile, the writing was so rushed (and yeah I know its a short story but still) The sex scenes felt like they were written by a horny teenager. I didn't read any chemistry with the characters and I'll be honest I have no clue what the point was?</span>

This is Mismousey’s very honest opinion of INDULGENCE.<br /><br />When I started reading this amazing book. I was not sure of the type of stories that would be included other than they would be Romance ones. I am so proud to have been asked to read &amp; review this. It was an honor and a privilege to do so.<br /><br />This being said – Let me tell you some about each story that is enclosed in this MUST READ BOOK.<br />Book 1 by AMITY CROSS<br /><br />***THIS STORY IS INCLUDED IN INDULGENCE~~~~~<br />OMG !! There are really no words to describe this story other than it is FANTASTIC AND LEAVES YOU WANTING MORE!<br />I received an ARC of this book from the very talented author Amity Cross. In exchange for an honest opinion. This is Mismousey’s very honest opinion of ROYAL BLOOD.<br />It is my honor and privilege to say that I was given this to read &amp; review. Having said that -the mouse wants you to know. That this is the first book that I have read written by Ms. Cross. She has a different style of writing from what I have read before. Ms. Cross takes her pen to paper and is able to create an OUTSTANDING MC BOOK. Her characters jump off the page at you. She captures the reader and holds you hostage with her plot-characters-scenes. This is one story you must read- make sure to add it to your to read list on Goodreads.<br /><br />Royal Blood is about a young women by the name of Mercy Reid. She is running from her past. And trying to create a whole new life for herself. That is until she stepped in to the Royal Blood MC Biker club. Mercy needs a job – and she is running from something or one.

As he is no good for her. But he falls for her and she him. At first they are just bed-buddies But as time goes on they become more to each other. Mercy doesn’t know what X does for the club. All she knows is that she has fallen for him.<br /><br />X is asked to take on a job outside the club. If he does then the club will let him go and he can leave. Although no one leaves the club once they become a member. They are in for life. X is asked to find the person responsible for the recent attempted hit on Sykes. Her name is Allison Crawford.

How the author ended this book has left me wanting to read more books in this series. All in all I have just found a new author to add books to my ever growing list of books to read. <br /><br />Angel Falling by Audrey Carlan<br />I've read several books by this author and this is another great book. I mean what else course you ask for with a hot and sexy cowboy out to win the heart of a sexy powerful business woman in New York. Of course within all the sexy times with Hank and Aspen is a great story of over coming two people from different social circles to show their love can over come anything. I just love all the characters in the story and how they made the story complete.<br /><br />Escaping Me by Cat Mason<br />This is a great rocker book and had me laughing with the funny things that the guys from Shaft would say. This books is HOT at times with a few sad parts worked into make it a really great story. I'll by looking forward to reading more of the authors books.<br /><br />Releasing Rage by Cynthia Sax<br />This story was completely different compared tot he other books that I have read. I like the strong female character that was in the story in the middle of a mostly male population. In all this was a very interesting story.<br /><br />My Last Dom by Deanndra Hall<br />Another awesome book by Deanndra Hall. She always finds a way to pull every emotion out of me when i read her books. She makes you laugh, makes you cry and then you just want to scream and throw the book. And this book doesn't lack in any of that and also add some super hot sex and its perfect. I completely love Jasper AKA Jax, Mr. hot sexy dome that completely stole my heart in this book. I can't wait for her next book to come out to read.<br /><br />Perpetual Love by Jamie Salisbury<br />This was such a sweet love story with a little suspense. I loved the main female character Anne. She always said what was on her mind and was a spitfire. This was not the usual type of book that i read, but rather enjoyed reading something different.<br /><br />Letting Go by JM Witt<br />This was suck a good book with a lot of suspense and romance with a little hint of BDSM in the story. James is one hot alpha male that totally takes your breath away. I was going crazy at the ending with the cliffhanger and wanted to know more. Can't wait to read the next book in this series.<br /><br />The Descendant by Kelley Grealis<br />The start of this book was a little confusing to me. You don't get the full picture till you get over half way through. Other than that part it was a different side to a vampire story.It was different having the story set in the same state I live in Ohio and Lake Erie.<br /><br />Rescued by Laura Harner<br />I really enjoyed this book and finding out there is more than this book makes me want to get the others and read them too. The mixture of love, suspense and tragedy was the perfect combo that kept you so involved in the story. This was a quick read but had a lot put into a good story in that short time. I can't wait to read more books in this series or others the author has written.<br /><br />Man On by Liz Crowe<br />Another great book by Liz Crowe. This story shows the struggle of one coming to terms of his true sexuality and another finding out he is able to love again. Really a great story and can't wait to red the rest in the series.<br /><br />Relent by Nina Levine<br />WOW, this was a really good MC Book. Evie and Kick what a match. Kick is a hot alpha male biker torn between being loyal to his club and wanting to be with the woman he loves. This was not just another MC story, but a deep vision like an episode of Sons of Anarchy. I felt like I was watching this story instead of reading it. I could imagine all the places and people in this story with how well the author described everything making me feel like I was in the story. I will be adding a few more books from this author to my reading list.<br /><br />Make Mine a Cowboy by Sandy Sullivan<br />This was suck a sweet and sexy cowboy story. I liked how Mesa was a romance writer of cowboy romance and falls for a cowboy. Joel completely swept me off my feet. Hot and sweet as pie cowboy with all the southern manners of a gentleman. I really enjoyed this book and will be looking into more books by this author.<br /><br />In all this was really a great collection of books all in one. You get such a wide variety of different types of romance stories and get a chance to reading something that you might not have before.<br /><br /></span>

  <span id="freeText8358200607863374764" style="display:none">Ho. Ly. Crap.<br /><br />I'll admit that I didn't really know what I was getting into when I started it. I've read anthologies before but very few that have this many full-length novels that cover so many different romance sub-genres. But I have to say that I'm immensely glad I was given the chance to review this collection.<br /><br />The most enjoyable aspect is that each story is different. There is no one genre to tie them all together except romance. Thank God for that because each story highlighted individuals so unique they couldn't have been confined to one sub-genre.<br /><br />Perhaps my favorite of all is Releasing Rage by Cynthia Sax. I'd just finished reading a scifi/fantasy romance by another author and was looking for something that would maintain the high I'd gotten from reading it. Rage was perfect. Joan was the perfect mate for Rage. The compassion she felt for cyborgs was borne from an experience years before when one rescued her. Not everyone shares her sentiment though and being assigned to care for Rage, who suffered abuse and torture from his previous handler, proves that point. And while the sex is hot, there's an undeniable sweetness to this story that melted my heart and overrode all the bad they'd both suffered before meeting each other.<br /><br />This anthology was incredible. Hot. Sexy. Dark. Seductive. Romantic. If you love any of the genres listed above, if you love any of the authors listed below, I hope you give this anthology a chance.<br />Some of the stories might suit you, some might not, but I hope you find at least one in this collection to enjoy as much as I did.<br /><br />4.5*<br />(Received from DRC Promotions for an honest review)</span>

I lost a lot of sleep reading this because I just could not put it down. I cannot write a review about each individual story here because then the review would just be too long.<br />These are not cookie cutter stories that feel like you are reading the same story over and over. Each one is unique and attention grabbing. Pick up a copy for yourself and prepare to be thoroughly entertained. <br />This is for sure a 5 ***** read for me. <br /></span>

From reading an Anthology, I came across you come to like many new authors in your reading to look into and read more of there published books. This collection of books was hard to put down and a must needed book collection for avid romance novel readers. This collection also has a wide variety of Genres to choose from and which, will also open your eyes to new genres you may have not thought of trying to read or didn't want to read. After reading this collection you may come across a new Genre you like. The books are very suspenseful and keeps you reading to the end of the collection. This is a great bargain as well for any book reader. </span>

Wealth, beauty, and a spot on the Forbes Top Ten Most Successful Women list. From the outside, she is perfect. Looks and status can be deceiving. All her life she has fought being the socialite her family has raised her to be. Now at twenty-eight she’s at the top of her game, lacking the one thing she didn’t know she’d ever want.\n\nAccidents happen and lives are changed when Aspen is almost killed. Hank Jensen, the man who saves her, is a hard-working country boy from Texas. Hank is the polar opposite of the rich city boys she’s used to. He’s rugged, gritty, devastatingly handsome, and makes it clear that he wants her in his life and his bed. \n\nCan two people from different worlds find a happily ever after? \n\nWarning: This book is designed for audiences 18+ due to language and graphic sexual content. This novel will be part of a three part series but is written as a standalone between this particular couple. The other two books in the series will focus on different characters with snippets of past couples as the stories move along.<\/span>\n  <a data-text-id=\"1004335440076126826\" href=\"#\" onclick=\"swapContent(\$(this));; return false;\">...more<\/a>\n\n    <\/div>\n\n      <div class=\'wtrButtonContainer wtrSignedOut\' id=\'4_book_20749908\'>\n<div class=\'wtrUp wtrLeft\'>\n<form action=\"/shelf/add_to_shelf\" accept-charset=\"UTF-8\" method=\"post\"><input name=\"utf8\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"&#x2713;\" /><input type=\"hidden\" name=\"authenticity_token\" value=\"pk7TA9bhHTuXj3aaj1yMrt8nMrhNPjTZOVcnL7wbonGrz4va7cbuls1oTGlrPNM/SLXrOc/O4dPc4Q7MDBKdrQ==\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"book_id\" id=\"book_id\" value=\"20749908\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"name\" id=\"name\" value=\"to-read\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"unique_id\" id=\"unique_id\" value=\"4_book_20749908\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"wtr_new\" id=\"wtr_new\" value=\"true\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"from_choice\" id=\"from_choice\" value=\"false\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"from_home_module\" id=\"from_home_module\" value=\"false\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"ref\" id=\"ref\" value=\"\" class=\"wtrLeftUpRef\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"existing_review\" id=\"existing_review\" value=\"false\" class=\"wtrExisting\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"book_origin\" id=\"book_origin\" value=\"series_works\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"page_url\" id=\"page_url\" value=\"/book/show/25662651-indulgence\" />\n<button class=\'wtrToRead\' type=\'submit\'>\n<span class=\'progressTrigger\'>Want to Read<\/span>\n<span class=\'progressIndicator\'>saving…<\/span>\n<\/button>\n<\/form>\n\n<\/div>\n\n<div class=\'wtrRight wtrUp\'>\n<form class=\"hiddenShelfForm\" action=\"/shelf/add_to_shelf\" accept-charset=\"UTF-8\" method=\"post\"><input name=\"utf8\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"&#x2713;\" /><input type=\"hidden\" name=\"authenticity_token\" value=\"7+3wdfTu3AR5tN4YtUhN9gOzhOOFSbxbhOSKe0wp6SHibKisz8kvqSNT5OtRKBJnlCFdYge5aVFhUqOY/CDW/Q==\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"unique_id\" id=\"unique_id\" value=\"4_book_20749908\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"book_id\" id=\"book_id\" value=\"20749908\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"a\" id=\"a\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"name\" id=\"name\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"from_choice\" id=\"from_choice\" value=\"false\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"from_home_module\" id=\"from_home_module\" value=\"false\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"book_origin\" id=\"book_origin\" value=\"series_works\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"page_url\" id=\"page_url\" value=\"/book/show/25662651-indulgence\" />\n<\/form>\n\n<button class=\'wtrShelfButton\'><\/button>\n<\/div>\n\n<div class=\'ratingStars wtrRating\'>\n<div class=\'starsErrorTooltip hidden\'>\nError rating book.

Unbroken by her tumultuous past, she is pursuing a stable and secure future that doesn’t include worrying about where the rent money will come from. Little does she know, a full-time position at Jensen Construction will do more than pay the bills, it will bring her everything she ever dreamed of having, but didn’t believe she was worthy of. \n\nKnown ladies’ man, Nathaniel “Nate” Walker, has never had a problem securing a date. As a widely successful lawyer and business owner, he knows exactly how to get what he wants, when he wants it, in and out of the courtroom… until he meets Camille Johnston. \n\nNate’s overly confident, alpha male tendencies toward Cami have her thoughts and emotions in a jumble of uncertainty and lust. But once the sparks fly between the cheeky lawyer and his precious Camille, the resounding flames are unstoppable. \n\nAs the couple try to find their way toward a future they both yearn for, secrets from Camille’s past and present start piling up into a vortex of half-truths and lies of omission. Now the instant connection that brought Nate and Cami together is held together by a tenuous thread. \n\nWith a little help from their friends, Camille and Nate’s steamy, romantic, breathless journey finishes off the third installment of The Falling Series.\n\nEach book in the Falling Series can be read as a standalone but are better when read together. All three books are intended for readers 18+ due to language and graphic sexual content.\n\nSuggested Reading Order: \nAngel Falling – Book 1\nLondon Falling – Book 2\nJustice Falling – Book 3<\/span>\n  <a data-text-id=\"13529127119177570841\" href=\"#\" onclick=\"swapContent(\$(this));; return false;\">...more<\/a>\n\n    <\/div>\n\n      <div class=\'wtrButtonContainer wtrSignedOut\' id=\'6_book_22825300\'>\n<div class=\'wtrUp wtrLeft\'>\n<form action=\"/shelf/add_to_shelf\" accept-charset=\"UTF-8\" method=\"post\"><input name=\"utf8\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"&#x2713;\" /><input type=\"hidden\" name=\"authenticity_token\" value=\"rZ8SRt1YBlgJ2JTOxPtv2WGFwOE7GvwgHD1nYeoaeqegHkqf5n/19VM/rj0gmzBI9hcZYLnqKSr5i06CWhNFew==\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"book_id\" id=\"book_id\" value=\"22825300\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"name\" id=\"name\" value=\"to-read\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"unique_id\" id=\"unique_id\" value=\"6_book_22825300\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"wtr_new\" id=\"wtr_new\" value=\"true\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"from_choice\" id=\"from_choice\" value=\"false\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"from_home_module\" id=\"from_home_module\" value=\"false\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"ref\" id=\"ref\" value=\"\" class=\"wtrLeftUpRef\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"existing_review\" id=\"existing_review\" value=\"false\" class=\"wtrExisting\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"book_origin\" id=\"book_origin\" value=\"series_works\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"page_url\" id=\"page_url\" value=\"/book/show/25662651-indulgence\" />\n<button class=\'wtrToRead\' type=\'submit\'>\n<span class=\'progressTrigger\'>Want to Read<\/span>\n<span class=\'progressIndicator\'>saving…<\/span>\n<\/button>\n<\/form>\n\n<\/div>\n\n<div class=\'wtrRight wtrUp\'>\n<form class=\"hiddenShelfForm\" action=\"/shelf/add_to_shelf\" accept-charset=\"UTF-8\" method=\"post\"><input name=\"utf8\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"&#x2713;\" /><input type=\"hidden\" name=\"authenticity_token\" value=\"bvYXpRRH5hjm7+wUAv3tNh6Q9vwXoaIBc7llRjFhZM1jd098L2AVtbwI1ufmnbKniQIvfZVRdwuWD0ylgWhbEQ==\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"unique_id\" id=\"unique_id\" value=\"6_book_22825300\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"book_id\" id=\"book_id\" value=\"22825300\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"a\" id=\"a\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"name\" id=\"name\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"from_choice\" id=\"from_choice\" value=\"false\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"from_home_module\" id=\"from_home_module\" value=\"false\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"book_origin\" id=\"book_origin\" value=\"series_works\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"page_url\" id=\"page_url\" value=\"/book/show/25662651-indulgence\" />\n<\/form>\n\n<button class=\'wtrShelfButton\'><\/button>\n<\/div>\n\n<div class=\'ratingStars wtrRating\'>\n<div class=\'starsErrorTooltip hidden\'>\nError rating book.
