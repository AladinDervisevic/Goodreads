Their resemblance to each other is uncanny, and they spend the next few hours talking and drinking - until at last John falls into a drunken stupor. It's to be his last carefree moment, for when he wakes, Jean has stolen his identity and disappeared. So the Englishman steps into the Frenchman's shoes, and faces a variety of perplexing roles - as owner of a chateau, director of a failing business, head of a fractious family, and master of nothing.<br /><br />Gripping and complex, <em>The Scapegoat</em> is a masterful exploration of doubling and identity, and of the dark side of the self.<br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div><div data-testid="genresList" class="BookPageMetadataSection__genres"><ul class="CollapsableList" aria-label="Top genres for this book"><span class="BookPageMetadataSection__genre"><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/genres/fiction" class="Button Button--tag-inline Button--medium"><span class="Button__labelItem">Fiction</span></a></span> <span class="BookPageMetadataSection__genre"><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/genres/classics" class="Button Button--tag-inline Button--medium"><span class="Button__labelItem">Classics</span></a></span> <span class="BookPageMetadataSection__genre"><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/genres/mystery" class="Button Button--tag-inline Button--medium"><span class="Button__labelItem">Mystery</span></a></span> <span class="BookPageMetadataSection__genre"><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/genres/gothic" class="Button Button--tag-inline Button--medium"><span class="Button__labelItem">Gothic</span></a></span> <div class="Button__container"><button type="button" class="Button Button--tag-inline Button--medium" aria-label="Show all items in the list"><span class="Button__labelItem">...more</span></button></div></ul></div><div class="BookDetails"><div class="CollapsableList"><span class="Text Text__body3"><div class="FeaturedDetails"><p data-testid="pagesFormat">384 pages, ebook</p><p data-testid="publicationInfo">First published January 1, 1957</p></div></span> <div class="Button__container"><button type="button" class="Button Button--inline Button--small" aria-label="Show more book details"><span class="Button__labelItem">More details</span></button></div></div></div><hr class="Divider" role="presentation"/><div class="AuthorPreview"><div class="AuthorPreview__profile"><div class="AuthorPreview__avatar"><a class="Avatar Avatar--large" href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2001717.Daphne_du_Maurier" as="div"><img data-testid="image" class="Avatar__image" alt="Daphne du Maurier" src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/authors/1422444467i/2001717._UX200_CR0,50,200,200_.jpg"/></a></div><div class="AuthorPreview__info"><h3 class="Text H3"><a class="ContributorLink" href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2001717.Daphne_du_Maurier"><span class="ContributorLink__name" data-testid="name">Daphne du Maurier</span></a></h3><div class="AuthorPreview__meta"><span class="Text Text__body3 Text__subdued">273<!-- --> <!-- -->books<span class="u-dot-before">7,097<!-- --> <!-- -->followers</span></span></div></div></div><div class="TruncatedText"><div class="TruncatedText__text TruncatedText__text--3" data-testid="contentContainer"><div><span class="Formatted">If Daphne du Maurier had written only <i>Rebecca</i>, she would still be one of the great shapers of popular culture and the modern imagination. Few writers have created more magical and mysterious places than Jamaica Inn and Manderley, buildings invested with a rich character that gives them a memorable life of their own.<br /><br />In many ways the life of Daphne du Maurier resembles a fairy tale. Born into a family with a rich artistic and historical background, the daughter of a famous actor-manager, she was indulged as a child and grew up enjoying enormous freedom from financial and parental restraint. She spent her youth sailing boats, travelling on the Continent with friends, and writing stories. A prestigious publishing house accepted her first novel when she was in her early twenties, and its publication brought her not only fame but the attentions of a handsome soldier, Major (later Lieutenant-General Sir) Frederick Browning, whom she married.<br /><br />Her subsequent novels became bestsellers, earning her enormous wealth and fame. While Alfred Hitchcock's film based upon her novel proceeded to make her one of the best-known authors in the world, she enjoyed the life of a fairy princess in a mansion in Cornwall called Menabilly, which served as the model for Manderley in <i>Rebecca</i>.<br /><br />Daphne du Maurier was obsessed with the past. She intensively researched the lives of Francis and Anthony Bacon, the history of Cornwall, the Regency period, and nineteenth-century France and England. Above all, however, she was obsessed with her own family history, which she chronicled in <i>Gerald: A Portrait</i>, a biography of her father; <i>The du Mauriers</i>, a study of her family which focused on her grandfather, George du Maurier, the novelist and illustrator for Punch; <i>The Glassblowers</i>, a novel based upon the lives of her du Maurier ancestors; and <i>Growing Pains</i>, an autobiography that ignores nearly 50 years of her life in favour of the joyful and more romantic period of her youth. Daphne du Maurier can best be understood in terms of her remarkable and paradoxical family, the ghosts which haunted her life and fiction.<br /><br />While contemporary writers were dealing critically with such subjects as the war, alienation, religion, poverty, Marxism, psychology and art, and experimenting with new techniques such as the stream of consciousness, du Maurier produced 'old-fashioned' novels with straightforward narratives that appealed to a popular audience's love of fantasy, adventure, sexuality and mystery. At an early age, she recognised that her readership was comprised principally of women, and she cultivated their loyal following through several decades by embodying their desires and dreams in her novels and short stories.<br /><br />In some of her novels, however, she went beyond the technique of the formulaic romance to achieve a powerful psychological realism reflecting her intense feelings about her father, and to a lesser degree, her mother. This vision, which underlies <i>Julius</i>, <i>Rebecca</i> and <i>The Parasites</i>, is that of an author overwhelmed by the memory of her father's commanding presence. In <i>Julius</i> and <i>The Parasites</i>, for example, she introduces the image of a domineering but deadly father and the daring subject of incest.<br /><br />In <i>Rebecca</i>, on the other hand, du Maurier fuses psychological realism with a sophisticated version of the Cinderella story. The nameless heroine has been saved from a life of drudgery by marrying a handsome, wealthy aristocrat, but unlike the Prince in Cinderella, Maxim de Winter is old enough to be the narrator's father. The narrator thus must do battle with The Other Woman—the dead Rebecca and her witch-like surrogate, Mrs Danvers—to win the love of her husband and father-figure.</span></div></div></div></div><hr

class="ReviewText"><section class="ReviewText__content"><div class="TruncatedText"><div class="TruncatedText__text TruncatedText__text--5" data-testid="contentContainer"><div><span class="Formatted">My only complaint with reading a Daphne du Maurier novel is that every book I pick up for some time afterwards pales in comparison. The depth of the characterizations, the richly described settings, and the undercurrent of suspense throughout never fail to enthrall me. No less so with this one, <b>The Scapegoat</b>. I found myself once again under du Maurier’s spell. <br /><br />John is an Englishman well-educated in everything French – the language, the history and the culture. He passes on all his knowledge as a lecturer at a university; he travels in France with ease. What he lacks, however, is a connection with the people. At the tail end of a tour in this country, John has fallen victim to a feeling of melancholy, of failure. He feels as an outsider, both in his own country of England as well as in France. He yearns to feel a part of the people, a kinship with his fellow human beings. <br /><br /><i>"Years of study, years of training, the fluency with which I spoke their language, taught their history, described their culture, had never brought me closer to the people themselves. I was too diffident, too conscious of my own reserve. My knowledge was library knowledge, and my day-by-day experience no deeper than a tourist’s gleanings. The urge to know was with me, and the ache. The smell of the soil, the gleam of the wet roads, the faded paint of shutters masking windows through which I should never look, the grey faces of houses whose doors I should never enter, were to me an everlasting reproach, a reminder of distance, of nationality. Others could force an entrance and break the barrier down: not I. I should never be a Frenchman, never be one of them."</i><br /><br />Anyone that has ever hungered to be a part of a group, but yet always felt as a stranger, will relate to John here. What should happen, however, if you had the opportunity to take someone’s place? Would you do it? When John bumps into an exact likeness of himself in a tavern, he is given precisely this chance. While John is a lonely man with a feeling of emptiness inside, Comte Jean de Gué claims to have only the problem of having too many ‘human’ possessions. Jean wants to play a clever game – that of switching identities with John and assuming each other’s lives. When John wakes the next morning, stripped of his own clothes and everything he had on his person, what choice does he have but to put on another man’s clothes, take his suitcase and assume this new life? <br /><br /><i>"Just as an actor paints old lines upon a young face, or hides behind the part he must create, so the old anxious self that I knew too well could be submerged and forgotten, and the new self would be someone without a care, without responsibility, calling himself Jean de Gué... "</i><br /><br />If only life were this simple. If only human relationships were straightforward, with little or no difficulties, no web of intricacies to disentangle. John, as the new Comte Jean de Gué, finds himself taking on a failing business and a family with secrets and complex feelings. John will come to know Jean through this family and his interactions with them. Jean may not be the kind of person our narrator would wish to emulate if given a choice. But isn’t he somehow responsible for these people now that he has allowed himself to be an accomplice to this deception? Does he want Jean to fail because he feels a victim in this charade? Perhaps John is Jean de Gué’s scapegoat, or maybe another is fulfilling this role in the drama that plays out in this wounded family. <br /><br />I was completely absorbed in this book. The psychological complexities and moral dilemmas, the Gothic-like atmosphere, and the superior writing that I have come to expect from Daphne du Maurier left me thoroughly satisfied. You really must read this if you have not. There’s so much more to this author than just her masterpiece, <b>Rebecca</b>, and you would be missing out if you didn’t immerse yourself in every last bit she had to offer – I know I will!<br

class="Formatted">‘WHO KNOWS WHAT EVIL LURKS IN THE HEART OF MEN?’<br />‘The SHADOW Knows...’<br />(with assorted Backstage Evil Cackles)<br />- WWII-Era Radio Show.<br /><br />Back in the J.F.K. Era, my grandmother belonged to the Book-of-the- Month Club. Is that still around? <br /><br />Anyway, one December she got a new book everybody was raving about back then - The Scapegoat. <br /><br />The deal was, if you didn’t mail the book back in time, it was yours. <br /><br />But - to her - it seemed the perfect Christmas gift for my young self! I never knew WHY until I finally started to read it, sixty-odd years later (thanks to my friend Sara’s recommendation on GR)!<br /><br />John is leading a drifting, meaningless life. Until... he meets his Shadow, the evil Frenchman Jean - his Exact Double. <br /><br />Evil Jean conks him out with booze, changes John's identity into his own privileged, noble one- then exits, stage right. <br /><br />John is left to himself in a strange château, with a strange new identity and even stranger new family. <br /><br />Will John fool them all and turn his madcap Shadow's Evil plans into Good - and finally give his own life purpose in the process?<br /><br />Okay! Now the reason why my grandmother gave it to me.<br /><br />I was like John as a kid - a reader; a dreamer; an underachiever. What was I worth to the world at large?<br /><br />Perhaps quite a lot! <br /><br />You see, the evil In this world never sleeps - but we’ll never know it if we’re hypnotized by all the glitz &amp; glam of the entertainment world...<br /><br />No, we won’t know. But the world knows US. <br /><br />And it wants to exchange identities with us. And totally assimilate our innocence into its own cynical essence. <br /><br />Some folks call it coming of age.<br /><br />And that’s the trick the worldly sophisticate Jean plays with his naïve lookalike!<br /><br />Don’t believe me? <br /><br />Take a look around you, at all those vast legions of cynical, weary, burnt-out souls - lost in their private hells.<br /><br />Yes, there was a wise warning in my Grandmother’s gift on the last Christmas of my preteens.<br /><br />Be careful HOW you mature!<br /><br />And keep your DREAMS &amp; IDEALS ALIVE.<br />***<br /><br />This classic gem is a piece of riveting. edge-of-your-seat suspense in the best tradition of the Queen of Cliffhangers.<br /><br />With all kinds of deeper meanings for EACH of us...<br /><br />And NOW you know just how wise my dear old grandmother was!</span></div></div></div></section></section><section class="ReviewCard__tags"><ul class="CollapsableList"><a

class="Formatted">Thank You to the MANY readers who came before me: I'm no longer a virgin to author <br />"Daphne Du Mauier". Special thanks to Jean, Sara, and Candy. <br /><br />Two men....one English, "John"...( the narrator), the other French, "Jean de Gue", meet by chance one evening. It's like looking into a mirror: they look almost identical- other than the color of their eyes. <br /><br />At the start of the novel, we learn that John- on holiday in France... <br />was a historian and gave lectures in England about his country and it's past. Not married - and has no children. <br />And even though he was English - he studied French for years. He taught their history, and described their culture, however he felt like an outsider - an alien. He wasn't one of them.... but wished to be. He wished to be bound by a family..... share their laughter and sorrow. <br />Due to his depression - he walked the streets at night in the rain and knew he must get drunk. He also was thinking of spending a few days at a monastery in hopes of finding the courage to go on living before returning to England. <br /><br />Over drinks in a bar, John shares with Jean de Gue how as an individual, he feels like a failure. <br /> Jean de Gue tells John that we've all 'failed' - everyone has. He tells him:<br /> "The secret of life is to recognize the fact early on, and become reconciled. Then it no longer matters". <br /> John says: "It does matter, I am not reconciled". <br />During this evening the men continue drinking and talking. Jean de Gue takes John to a restaurant....driving John's car ( after all, he knows it city best), and brings them to a shabby hotel.... and says "Sometimes, these places can be useful". <br />USEFUL FOR WHAT??? <br />After the fourth drink....the men let down their guards more. <br />John continued to talk about loneliness, death, and the empty shell of his personal world. <br /> Jean de Gue, master of a chateau, and director of a failing business says, "You complain that your life is empty", to me it sounds like paradise. An apartment to yourself, no family, no business worries". <br />Jean de Gue's voice changed - its clear he had personal problems too - felt resentment. He said he had a sister who only thinks about religion and nothing else. <br />He thinks the only motive force in human nature is "GREED". People in Jean de Gue's life were never satisfied--[from his point of view]. <br /><br />So... I ask: .... if you have read this far:<br /> .....which of these two men's life sounds most attractive to you? Would you rather be without a family, with no responsibilities, but also feel lonely, depressed and empty? <br />Or, have many people counting on you - wife - mother - daughter - brother - sister-in-law- friends with benefits - business associates- and feel resentful? <br />And if you could step into one of these men's lives - by trading places --as a stranger/ actor taking over the role.... how do you think you might make a difference? And how might you do harm? In THIS story...we get the opportunity to watch how the entire scenario - this crazy game - so to speak - affects each person. <br /><br />As this story plays out ..... we watch how brilliantly John steps into Jean de Gue's life.....Funny transition scene - had to chuckle- a little! <br /><br />Jean de Gue had acted wrongly. He ran away from his life, he escaped the emotions that he himself created. John brought forth 'his' emotions - and whether right or wrong...( I think even the most skeptical readers can suspend disbelief, in this masterfully written fiction novel), .....I had faith that what John was searching for would somehow transform not only him but heal bruised family members with empathy and love. But how? And at what cost? <br /><br />When John first stepped into Jean de Gue's life, he noticed that his mother looked frightened. His sister silent. His brother hostile. His sister-in-law angry. His wife crying, and his daughter threw a tantrum. The dog, ignored him. <br /><br />There are some "OH BOY" situations.... sticky as taffy! Also, this story is simply a <br />compelling fantasy ride with marvelous prose to boot! <br />The ending of this story calls for discussion!!! Personally -- I think it fits! <br /><br />Off to join my group and read what others are saying! A book so much richer than many of the newer fiction books I often read. Just sayin! <br /><br />A DELICIOUS BOOK!!! At least one of my top 20 favorites of all times!!!!!</span></div></div></div></section></section><section class="ReviewCard__tags"><ul class="CollapsableList"><a

class="Formatted">Have you ever wanted to run away from your life? What would happen if you suddenly had the chance to; would you "grasp the nettle"? Or what if a new life was imposed on you, whether you liked it or not? Such is the premise of Daphne du Maurier's 1957 novel, <b>The Scapegoat.</b><br /><br /><b>The Scapegoat</b> is reminiscent of novels such as, <i>"The Prisoner of Zenda"</i> and according to one of Daphne du Maurier's biographers, this rollicking adventure was a favourite story of Daphne's when she was a little girl. But it also owes a great deal to <i>"Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde"</i> as Daphne du Maurier also explores how two selves begin to feel as if they are part of the same person, the viewpoint character. In fact it is neither a straightforward adventure story as in Anthony Hope's tale, nor a dark study of two individuals; personalities within the same body, as in Robert Louis Stevenson's classic horror story. It lies somewhere between the two, yet is also an unsettling tale, full of suspense, sometimes even having a dream-like quality. <br /><br />Daphne du Maurier had the idea for <b>The Scapegoat</b> when she was in France in 1955, to research the lives of her ancestors, the Busson-Mathurins, who were glass-blowers. She did subsequently write the novel for which she intended this research, entitling it <i>"The Glassblowers"</i> (1963). But before writing it, she became distracted by a number of incidents that happened to her in France, which inspired the plot of <b>The Scapegoat</b>, published in 1957. She apparently wrote it at record speed, finishing within six months, and then collapsed with nervous exhaustion.<br /><br />One of the triggers was that while out for a walk in a square in a French town, Daphne du Maurier saw a man who looked identical to someone she happened to know. According to one of her biographers, Judith Cook, she then watched a family scene through a window, and began to put the two incidents together in her feverish imagination. Typically, she began to wonder about the people; who they were, and what their secrets might be, <br /><br /><i>"She imagined herself suddenly transported into their midst, listening to their conversation, perhaps even becoming one of them,"</i><br /><br />and so the seeds of <b>The Scapegoat</b> were sown.<br /><br />Another instance provides part of the novel's setting. Houses often seem to take on a life of their own in Daphne du Maurier's novels. For example, <i>"Manderley"</i> in <i>"Rebecca"</i>, seems to be imbued with as much of a presence - to be as much a character - as any of the actual people in the book. Indeed in her own life, she seems to have had an almost obsessive love for her <i>"Menabilly"</i> the house she rented for so many years. Here in France, as part of her research, Daphne du Maurier discovered a house that had belonged to one of her ancestors two hundred years earlier. Exploring the derelict buildings, she saw fragments of the glass they had made, still there, scattered by the wind. She used these impressions and experiences, drawing on them to create an atmospheric, dramatic suspense novel, set in France. <br /><br />In <b>The Scapegoat</b>, her ancestral glass-blowing foundry became the failing business of the de Gué family. They in turn were depicted as more grand, in fact minor aristocrats, the Comte and Comtesse. And instead of writing herself into the story, the author took on the guise of a male narrator, one of five occasions in major novels when she did this.<br /><br />The narrator, and viewpoint character, is an Englishman named John. At the start of the novel we learnt that John is dissatisfied with his life as a university lecturer, and tending to become depressed with what he sees as a futile life. It is evident that he is travelling through France, where he meets a man who eerily is his double in looks; a confident French count, Jean de Gué. Intrigued despite himself, John plays along with the Count's wishes, indulging in a night of drinking, and staying in an anonymous downbeat hotel overnight. On waking, he discovers that the man has disappeared, taking all John's own clothes and belongings, and leaving him to play the role of the "Comte Jean de Gué". Thus we have the novel's basic premise.<br /><br />At first confused, John then becomes angry,<br /><br /><i>"filled with an intense desire to get away from that dingy, shabby hotel and never set eyes on it again, and as my anger rose and self-disgust took possession of me..."</i><br /><br />And a little later, he describes being,<br /><br /><i>"possessed by a reckless feeling I had never known before, the sensation that I myself did not matter any more... no one could call me to account for any action. For the first time I was free."</i><br /><br />He thus become his double's scapegoat, and the events which follow enmesh him further in deceit and duplicity, which at first he considers to be in itself wrong, but quickly comes to regard as a means of basic survival, <br /><br /><i>"My sense of power was unbounded... I felt my bluff to be superb, and it must have worked... My self-confidence mounting every moment... I recalled my success the night before... little scraps of family history fell on my ear... what I gleaned would have to be sorted and sifted at leisure."</i><br /><br />John learns about the idiosyncratic family he has been thrust amidst. He learns how his doppelgänger had influenced the destinies of these individuals, mercilessly twisting their lives to his own purpose. Gradually John begins to feel sympathy for the family who have accepted him, John, totally at face value. They have treated him variously with the emotions he has seemed to lack in his life so far; that is with love or hatred, but rarely with indifference. And as the novel proceeds we become aware that John has become emotionally committed to this family, within the space of seven days. He determines to use his family position as a tool, to influence both the workers in the factory, and "his" individual family member's lives for the better. Although a scapegoat, he is desperate to learn everything about the family intrigues, deceptions, jealousies and murders, both the events in the past and also those in the present.<br /><br />Indeed there are at least two other contenders for the description of "scapegoat". Either the daughter or the wife could be seen in these terms. Marie-Noel seems over-eager to sacrifice herself for her father, as does Françoise, the Count's wife. The intensity of the little girl Marie-Noel's relationship with her father is clearly a reflection of that between the author, Daphne du Maurier, and her own father, the charismatic actor-manager Gerald du Maurier. <br /><br />But Daphne du Maurier's descriptions of the little girl's religious fervour, as well as that of her aunt Blanche, serve well to heighten the tension at various points. It borders on the macabre, and makes the novel seem almost a gothic tale. All Daphne du Maurier's novels are tightly plotted, and this one, like <i>"My Cousin Rachel"</i> is full of suspense, coincidence, hints and dark secrets. The narrator continually suspects various members of his family - including his doppelgänger - of not only duplicity, but also of some evil deeds in the past. The whole novel is driven by the narrator's desperate desire for knowledge and understanding. He never reflects back on what has led him to this point, or what his life has been so far, but always concentrates on remaining undiscovered, and as the novel proceeds, on influencing the future of his "adopted family" for their good.<br /><br />As with many of Daphne du Maurier's novels, there are so many elements of mystery that it is sometimes rather like reading a detective story. She often drops hints to the reader; clues carefully planted so that the reader is able to puzzle out the various roles and relationships before the viewpoint character John does. We suspect Renée's behaviour, for example, before John seems to have an inkling of why she seems so overly flirtatious and petulant. And we know who the woman Béla in the neighbouring village of Villars must be.<br /><br />We see as the novel proceeds, a merging of the two John/Jeans,<br /><br /><i>"The feeling of power, of triumph that I was outwitting this little group of unsuspecting people had turned again to shame. It seemed to me now that I wanted Jean de Gué to have been a different sort of man. I did not want to discover at each step that he was worthless... I had exchanged my own negligible self for a worthless personality. He had the supreme advantage over me in that he had not cared. Or had he, after all? Was this why he had disappeared?"</i><br /><br />And later,<br /><br /><i>"I knew that everything I had said or done had implicated me further, driven me deeper, bound me more closely still to that man whose body was not my body, whose mind was not my mind, whose thoughts and actions were a world apart, and yet whose inner substance was part of my nature, part of my secret self."</i><br /><br />At this point just less than half-way through, the dream-like quality is notched up a step, and we realise that John is beginning to perceive another, darker, personality hidden within his own self, much as the character <i>"Doctor Jekyll"</i> did, but more subtly. Although Jekyll became subsumed and ultimately destroyed by the malignant influence of Hyde, John conversely seems to become more self-possessed and confident through his exploration of his darker self. He seems to become, in a sense, a more complete character, and his past a mere shadow.<br /><br />There are recurring themes in this novel. Take the motif of a broken ornament, for instance. In <i>"Rebecca"</i>, the episode where the new wife accidentally destroys a valuable china ornament given to her predecessor (Rebecca) on her marriage, and becoming a particular favourite, is powerfully symbolic. Here there is a similar event involving Anne-Marie and her mother, and a porcelain cat and dog,<br /><br /><i>"the only things I possess and value in this house."</i><br /><br />Real-life dogs are another device. There are heart-stopping moments where the readers wonder whether the dog will recognise the supplanted character of John, in the place of César's master, the Count. In <i>"Rebecca"</i>, the dog is suspicious for a long time of the new wife. In both cases the apprehension devolves on the viewpoint character. When César, the dog, finally accepts John, the author says,<br /><br /><i>"as he wagged his tail, I felt that I had scored a triumph."</i><br /><br />The writing style too, feels very like Daphne du Maurier's other novels. There is much description to add colour and mood. On quite a few occasions she will use personification, or even the pathetic fallacy, to influence and further heighten the atmosphere, such as when,<br /><br /><i>"There was no break in the weeping sky to give direction."</i><br /><br />At one point halfway through the novel, John feels that he is trapped in a corner. He feels impotent, and that whatever he does will not work; he is sinking further and further into a morass of his own making. The author describes the scene outside the house, <br /><br /><i>"Immediately beside me was a gargoyle's head, ears flattened, slits for eyes, the jutting lips forming a spout for rain. The leaded guttering was choked with leaves, and when rain came the whole would turn to mud and pour from the gargoyle's mouth in a turbid stream... seeping down the walls, swirling in the runways, choking and gurgling above the gargoyle head, driving sideways like arrows to the windows, stinging the panes... there would be no other sound for hour after hour... but the falling rain, and the flood of leaves and rubble through the gargoyle's mouth."</i><br /><br />On another occasion, when the reader is finally about to learn the truth about the mysterious Maurice Duval,<br /><br /><i>"A fluttering sound by the window made me turn my head. It was a butterfly, the last of the long summer, woken by sunshine, seeking escape from the cobwebs that imprisoned it. I released the butterfly from its prison, and it hovered a moment on the sill, then settled once more amongst the cobwebs."</i><br /><br />The novel hurtles to its conclusion, within its short compressed time-frame, as John desperately tries to right the wrongs as he sees them. Increasingly he is more committed, yet contrarily also more unsure,<br /><br /><i>"I wondered how much further I had to fall, and if the sense of shame that overwhelmed me was merely wallowing in darkness... I had played the coward long enough."</i><br /><br />When the dog, César, drags him at reckless speed through the woods, it is as if John's own darker side is "dogging" him,<br /><br /><i>"I dragged myself to my feet, and with my hell-hound in tow started off once more through the vastness of the wood, feeling, as the poet did before me, that my companion would be with me through the nights and through the days, and down the arches of the years, and I should never be rid of him."</i> <br /><br />Even the structure of this one sentence gives the impression of hurtling towards doom. It does not let up; there is no break.<br /><br />Towards the conclusion, the identification, or perhaps the confusion or melding of the two characters John/Jean, becomes ever more apparent. Here John refers to an event long past, but seems to also draws truths from it about his doppelgänger, <br /><br /><i>"I knew that what had happened on a dark night nearly fifteen years ago had not come about by chance but was something planned and done deliberately by a man without heart or feeling, who saw perhaps, in the other someone finer than himself possessing... all the qualities he himself lacked."</i><br /><br />Yet he still fears discovery,<br /><br /><i>"...she knows at last. I've given myself away... But I was wrong."<br /><br />"I could not ask forgiveness for something I had not done. As scapegoat I could only bear the fault."</i><br /><br />On the penultimate page, the transmogrification is complete,<br /><br /><i>"I walked on through darkness, undergrowth and moss, and now I had no present and no past, the self who stumbled had no heart and mind..."<br /><br />"wishing to condemn him, it was as if it was the shadow I condemned, the man who had moved and spoken and acted in his place, and not Jean de Gué at all. <br />"It's no use... I'm not describing the man you know."<br />"You are... but you're describing yourself as well."<br />There was the fear. Which one of us was real?... It struck me suddenly that if I should now look at myself in a mirror I should see no reflection."</i><br /><br />This is a disturbing tale, and it comes as no surprise to learn how emotionally drained and disturbed the author was on its completion. Events in Daphne du Maurier's own life were mirrored within the novel, and the author became increasingly jittery and confused as to which had actually happened first. When she wrote about the character Françoise needing a blood transfusion, in real life shortly afterwards, her daughter Tessa gave birth to a son who needed two blood transfusions. Her biographer Judith Cook says, of the odd coincidences and connections,<br /><br /><i>"Daphne began to find it all rather frightening."</i> <br /> <br />And another biographer, Margaret Forster, reprints a letter, which Daphne du Maurier wrote in the same year of <b>The Scapegoat</b>'s publication, 1957, just after her (Daphne's) husband Tommy had had a nervous breakdown. She herself was also on the verge of nervous collapse. In it, she talks about her novel, <br /><br /><i>"It is my story, and it is [his] also. We are both doubles. So it is with everyone. Every one of us has his, or her, dark side. Which is to overcome the other? This is the purpose of the book. And it ends, as you know, with the problem unsolved, except that the suggestion there, when I finished it, was that the two sides of that man's nature had to fuse together to give birth to a third, well balanced. Know Thyself. <input type="checkbox" class="spoiler__control" aria-label="The following text has been marked spoiler. Toggle checkbox to reveal or hide." onchange="this.labels[0].setAttribute('aria-hidden', !this.checked);" id="4cfe663a-0601-4c56-ac9c-b496f6a2ed46" /><label aria-hidden="true" class="spoiler" for="4cfe663a-0601-4c56-ac9c-b496f6a2ed46">The one man went back home having been given a hint that his family, in future, would be different, would be adjusted; the other man went to the monastery, for a space of time, to learn "what to do with love". </label>Can Moper, and can I, learn from this? I think we can ... but the dark side is not yet destroyed. We must be patient."</i><br /><br />The ending she refers to comes across to the reader as quite weak. It provides neither the delicious twist we have learnt to expect from this author, nor the massive ambiguity she can do so well. Clearly from this letter though, it is what she intended, and perhaps had to wrestle with internally herself. Perhaps after all it is a fitting ending to a novel, in which she delved into John/Jean's - and possibly her own - psyche and explored other, imaginary selves. Did she explore mere fantasies, or their secret lives? Increasingly after this novel, she became intrigued by what she called the "dark side" of our natures, and some of her best short stories and novellas, explore this theme. <i>"Don't Look Now", "The Blue Lenses"</i>, and <i>"The Breakthrough"</i>, are examples. They too are macabre and strange, tense and chillingly unexpected tales, relying on the same speculative atmosphere of suspense and mystery, both disturbing and uncanny.<br /><br /><b>Note:</b><br /><br /><b>The Scapegoat</b> was made into a film in 1959 starring Alec Guinness and Bette Davis. Additionally there is a 2012 film with Matthew Rhys which is based on the novel. However this is not set in France but in the UK in 1952 just before the coronation. Teacher John Standing, who has just lost his job, meets his doppelgänger Johnny Spence, a failed businessman. Thus none of the French associations are there, and in fact the story is entirely different, with different characters, different major and critical episodes - and even a different ending!<br /><br

French language academic John is astonished to bump into his exact doppelganger at a provincial French train station.<br><img src="https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1608475289ra/30562043.gif" class="gr-hostedUserImg" loading="lazy"><br>He's further astonished to wake up (after a night out), the next morning and find that his double, Frenchman Jean, has disappeared with John's identity! With little other choice John returns to Jean's home and finds himself taking over Jean's life! A life with a precocious daughter, a heavily pregnant wife, lots of adultery, an ailing mother, unhappy siblings,a failing company and a village still struggling with the demons of a NAZI occupied past and how they dealt with the collaborators 15 years ago.<br><img src="https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1608475289ra/30562041.gif" class="gr-hostedUserImg" loading="lazy"><br>Daphne weaved a compelling tale from the off, from the mystery of the identical men to the shit-show that Jean's life is; but where she excels is the intricacies of the extended family's life and history; the multiple distinct voices and relationships with Jean, and then John, and just overall taking a superb suspense thriller and making it much more, very much more! 9 out of 12.<br>A GIF to sum up how I feel about du Maurier?<br><img src="https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1608475289ra/30562042.gif" class="gr-hostedUserImg" loading="lazy"></span></div></div></div></section></section><section

class="Formatted">I've often fantasized about escaping my own life and transplanting somewhere else entirely. Better yet, trade places with my dog, Zelda. Du Maurier explores that idea here, through the characters of John (the English man) and Jean (the French man) who meet by chance one night and discover that while they might be strangers, <i>they look exactly alike</i>. Time for the old switcheroo?<br><br>John, our narrator, is a lonely academic, someone who always felt like an observer rather than a participant in life. Jean, on the other hand, describes himself as a "family man" who evidently doesn't enjoy the title and is only too happy to jump ship.<br><br>The story follows John, who tries his best to live his doppelgänger's life without making too many missteps or being discovered as a fraud. Turns out, the life he is to assume is a complicated one. Suddenly, he's a man with a depressed wife, a crumbling chateau, a failing glass foundry, a mistress in town, a mistress in the house, a sister who hasn't spoken to him in fifteen years, a troubled daughter and mysteriously ill mother. Plus a dark history that no one dares to speak of.<br><br>John is truly a scapegoat, held responsible for acts committed by another man:<br><br><i>I could not ask for forgiveness for something I had not done. As scapegoat, I could only bear the fault.</i><br><br>There's a fair amount of suspension of disbelief that is required on the part of the reader, but du Maurier is so skilled at engaging us, there were very few times that I stopped or scratched my head. I was only too happy to be along for the ride. The way she slowly reveals information is well timed, a natural unfolding.<br><br>One thing I noticed and found surprising is that the book is less gothic than the other novels of hers that I've read (<i>Rebecca</i>, <i>My Cousin Rachel</i>). There are fewer of the traditional gothic tropes on display (the house as a main character, ghosts or dead who preoccupy the minds of the characters, letters received from people long dead, animals who meet bad ends, dark eroticism). I'd say this book is more of a mystery, if I had to classify it.<br><br>The ending is also surprising - I didn't see it coming. Again, less gothic, but satisfying (although I must say, it left me quite curious as to what followed the final page). In the end, it's another spellbinding story woven by a truly gifted writer. A story that examines identity and fate in a thoughtful way, written in the author's elegant but provoking pen.<br><br>(I still want to trade places with Zelda, by the way.)<br><br><br><img

4.5 stars<br /><br /> I have read several of Daphne Du Maurier's books and loved every single one. Rebecca is my favorite but this book came very close to it.<br />I will be reading more of her books.<br /><br /> What would you do if you came face to face with yourself? That's what happens to John, an Englishman on holiday in France, when he meets his exact double - a Frenchman called Jean de Gue. John agrees to go for a drink with Jean but falls into a drunken stupor and wakes up in a hotel room to find that Jean has disappeared, taking John's clothes and identity documents with him!<br /><br />When Jean's chauffeur arrives at the hotel, John is unable to convince him of what has happened - and ends up accompanying the chauffeur to Jean de Gue's chateau, where the Frenchman's unsuspecting family assume that he really is Jean de Gue. Naturally, they expect him to continue running the family glass-making business and arranging shooting parties - things that John has absolutely no experience in. Before long, it starts to become obvious that Jean is using John as a scapegoat; Jean's family and business are both in a mess and he wants someone else to have to deal with them.<br /><br />Throughout the book, I was forced to revise my opinions once or twice about what was really going on. If everything in the book is supposed to be taken literally, then we need to suspend belief at times: could two men really be so identical that even their mother, wife and daughter can't tell the difference? There is also another way to interpret the story, one which goes deeper into the psychology of identity - I won't say any more about that here, but if you read the book this theory may occur to you too. I found the book very thought provoking.<br /><br />As usual, du Maurier's writing is wonderfully atmospheric. She has a way of making you feel as though you're actually there in the hotel room in Le Mans, the grounds of Jean de Gue's estate in the French countryside and Bela's antique shop in the town of Villars.<br /><br />When John first arrives at the de Gue chateau, every member of the household is a stranger to him but we (and John) are given enough clues to gradually figure out who each person is and what their relationship is to Jean de Gue. From the neglected pregnant wife and the hostile elder sister to the resentful younger brother and the religious ten-year-old daughter, every character is well-drawn and memorable.<br /><br />Another thing I love about Daphne du Maurier's writing is her ability to always keep the reader guessing right to the final page (and sometimes afterwards too). This was a fascinating and unusual story.</span></div></div></div></section></section><section class="ReviewCard__tags"><ul class="CollapsableList"><a

must admit to feeling a little nervous about taking on this book. Novels of 'a certain age’ really aren’t my thing, I seem to struggle with everything about them. If it's not the stilted or overblown language it is a plot that feels horribly tame and dated. If there’s a phobia attached to reading these books, then I have it. I’d never read a book by Daphne du Maurier before so I wasn’t sure quite which I'd get - the overblown or the stilted - but I was confident the plot would be asinine. And guess what, I was right! But I was also wrong…<br /><br />John, a discontented English academic travelling in France meets an unhappy Frenchman who, by chance, is his doppelganger. They share a drink and then a few more. Before long John has passed out and when he wakes he realises that his identity has been stolen – Jean, his Gallic lookalike, has run off with his clothes, wallet and car. This is the point where the story takes a fairly unlikely turn (if it hadn’t already) in that John decides to live Jean’s life, moving in with his family and picking up the loose threads of the life Jean had left behind. Strange, unlikely… both? Yes. But stranger still is the fact that I slowly became drawn into the story and significantly invested in the outcome.<br /><br />The language is rich and hugely descriptive – all in a good way – and as the tale gallops along more and more problems seem to crawl out of the woodwork. Can John possibly add value here, can he right the wrongs and solve some of the problems? He is certainly going to have his hands full as there is much to do if he is to right this particular ship. <input type="checkbox" class="spoiler__control" aria-label="The following text has been marked spoiler.

From this point on it was easy – and hugely enjoyable. As I approached the end I started to worry whether du Maurier would land a bail out happy ending on her readers, even though I couldn’t really work out what this would look like. I needn’t have worried, the story was tied up brilliantly and in a way I couldn’t have foreseen. <br /><br />Memo to myself: don’t be so dismissive of books written before I was born – I can learn much from them and the medicine to cure my phobia is simple enough, seek out my next one PDQ.</span></div></div></div></section></section><section class="ReviewCard__tags"><ul

class="Formatted">If you have ever read any of Daphne du Maurier’s novels, you will immediately recognize what I mean when I say the narrator here is another of her identity-free individuals. Like the new Mrs. De Winter in Rebecca or the tour guide brother in Flight of the Falcon, this narrator is a person without any sense of importance, sense of self or sense of his own value. He is so unloved and disconnected that he can assume another man’s life and involve himself immediately in the other man’s world to the point of burying himself inside the other man’s skin.<br /><br /><i>A scapegoat: a person who is blamed for the wrongdoings, mistakes, or faults of others.</i> What an inspired title for Daphne du Maurier’s thrilling novel of exchanged identity. When John, an Englishman whose area of expertise is France, meets his doppelganger, the Comte Jean de Gue, he finds himself unexpectedly tricked into trading places. He goes from having no life or ties to being responsible for the complexities of a chateaux and the lives that revolve around it, and he finds out that the life he has assumed is one of a dubious and sometimes cruel individual.<br /><br /><i>"One had no right to play with other people's lives. One should not interfere with their emotions. A word, a look, a smile, a frown, did something to another human being, waking response or aversion, and a web was woven which had no beginning and no end, spreading outward and inward too, merging, entangling, so that the struggle of one depended on the struggle of the other."</i><br /><br />As our narrator uncovers the secrets of Jean’s life, he begins to insert his own sensibilities into the lives he controls. But does he see these people as they are, or does he supply his on version of them? Does he help them, or does he simply confuse and disrupt their lives? What would they think if they knew he was just a stranger playing at being their son, husband, father, brother, lover or master? And, what does he discover about himself along the way? <br /><br />Nobody writes romantic gothic fiction like du Maurier. She knows how to make something subtle important. She has great command of the psychological thriller and weaves her tales to that you are never far from the edge of your seat. She writes descriptions that turn buildings into characters, and characters that emerge as real people.<br /><br />If you have never read du Maurier, you are missing one of the great writers. If you have not read this book, you are missing a treat.</span></div></div></div></section></section><section class="ReviewCard__tags"><ul class="CollapsableList"><a

class="TruncatedText"><div class="TruncatedText__text TruncatedText__text--5" data-testid="contentContainer"><div><span class="Formatted">I did not see the ending coming. I thought I knew how it was going to end…Dame du Maurier it appeared to me was right near the end leading me and other readers down the primrose path to the denouement. Not so fast. 😮<br /><br />I had read two other books by Dame Daphne du Maurier and very much liked them: Rebecca (1938) and My Cousin Rachel (1951). I had never heard of this book (originally published in 1957) BUT SEE BELOW …until several months ago it got a favorable review from a GR friend. So I put it on my TBR list…got it from the library and devoured it in one day. The edition I got was by the University of Pennsylvania Press, and it was already in its 5th printing. I wonder why a university press would be publishing Daphne du Maurier…on the back cover it was stated that The House on the Strand was also available via the university press. <br /><br />The basic plot is that a Frenchman in his early 40s runs into another man, an Englishman in his early 40s, who is a body double of him (doppelgänger). By clever means and not to his liking the Englishman finds himself forced to impersonate the Frenchman and inherits the Frenchman’s life and family…a brother and a sister and a mother and they’re all messed up to varying degrees, and a wife, and she is unhappy because her husband has been essentially ignoring her and only married her for a potential buttload of money if she produces a son for him (complicated legal arrangement regarding her dowry). Oh and that’s just the beginning…he inherits a precocious 11-year old daughter, a sister-in-law (who he is having an affair with), a valet, a mistress, a glass factory that is floundering… And given this is a du Maurier novel there have been sinister things happening well into the past…that this Englishman now fake Frenchman is going to have to deal with. Perhaps vaguely reminiscent of ‘Heaven Can Wait’, a film from the late 1970s starring Warren Beatty and Julie Christie (and a gaggle of other good actors)…although that was a comedy/love story when push comes to shove. Not a whole lot to laugh at in this novel. In fact nothing really. <br />Which doesn’t mean this novel is not good — I think it’s pretty damn good. And I am glad I read it. 😊<br /><br />It held my interest pretty much throughout, although maybe about two-thirds of the way through my interest flagged but then accelerated again — just a minor bump in the road. Otherwise I think I would have rated it as ‘5’ rather than ‘4’…but in my rating system a ‘4’ is “a memorable read and if there is anything else the author has written I would be quite interested in it”, thank you very much.<br /><br /><br />😢<br />I just looked at an Excel database I have kept for some 15 years or so and have discovered I read this in 2001. How could I forget reading this book??? It’s like I read it for the first time today! In fact you can see from my review above I was assuming this was the first tine I had laid eyes on this book. I know some books are certainly worth reading two times…but yeesh. Maybe I should be taking a buttload of Prevogen. After all, it contains an ingredient found in jellyfish. Or so the ad says…I wonder if jellyfish have good memories? Apparently they have better memories than I.🤨<br /><br />Reviews:<br />From a blog site: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" href="https://thelitedit.com/the-scapegoat-daphne-du-maurier/">https://thelitedit.com/the-scapegoat-...</a><br />From a sci-fi newsletter (a very good review): <a target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" href="https://www.tor.com/2010/09/12/youre-not-the-devil-by-any-chance-daphne-du-mauriers-the-scapegoat/">https://www.tor.com/2010/09/12/youre-...</a><br /><a target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" href="https://www.literaryladiesguide.com/book-description/scapegoat-1956-daphne-dumaurier-2/">https://www.literaryladiesguide.com/b...</a><br /><br />This was made into a movie in 1959 starring Alec Guinness and Bette Davis. I am not sure it was a hit (actually this site [<a target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Scapegoat_(1959_film)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sca...</a>] said it lost over $300,000 when all was said and done). Reinforces the truism that the book is typically better than the movie. Although it was based on the book, the screenplay was written by Gore Vidal and Robert Hamer.</span></div></div></div></section></section><section class="ReviewCard__tags"><ul

du Maurier","description":"If Daphne du Maurier had written only \u003ci\u003eRebecca\u003c/i\u003e, she would still be one of the great shapers of popular culture and the modern imagination. Few writers have created more magical and mysterious places than Jamaica Inn and Manderley, buildings invested with a rich character that gives them a memorable life of their own.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eIn many ways the life of Daphne du Maurier resembles a fairy tale. Born into a family with a rich artistic and historical background, the daughter of a famous actor-manager, she was indulged as a child and grew up enjoying enormous freedom from financial and parental restraint. She spent her youth sailing boats, travelling on the Continent with friends, and writing stories. A prestigious publishing house accepted her first novel when she was in her early twenties, and its publication brought her not only fame but the attentions of a handsome soldier, Major (later Lieutenant-General Sir) Frederick Browning, whom she married.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eHer subsequent novels became bestsellers, earning her enormous wealth and fame. While Alfred Hitchcock's film based upon her novel proceeded to make her one of the best-known authors in the world, she enjoyed the life of a fairy princess in a mansion in Cornwall called Menabilly, which served as the model for Manderley in \u003ci\u003eRebecca\u003c/i\u003e.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eDaphne du Maurier was obsessed with the past. She intensively researched the lives of Francis and Anthony Bacon, the history of Cornwall, the Regency period, and nineteenth-century France and England. Above all, however, she was obsessed with her own family history, which she chronicled in \u003ci\u003eGerald: A Portrait\u003c/i\u003e, a biography of her father; \u003ci\u003eThe du Mauriers\u003c/i\u003e, a study of her family which focused on her grandfather, George du Maurier, the novelist and illustrator for Punch; \u003ci\u003eThe Glassblowers\u003c/i\u003e, a novel based upon the lives of her du Maurier ancestors; and \u003ci\u003eGrowing Pains\u003c/i\u003e, an autobiography that ignores nearly 50 years of her life in favour of the joyful and more romantic period of her youth. Daphne du Maurier can best be understood in terms of her remarkable and paradoxical family, the ghosts which haunted her life and fiction.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eWhile contemporary writers were dealing critically with such subjects as the war, alienation, religion, poverty, Marxism, psychology and art, and experimenting with new techniques such as the stream of consciousness, du Maurier produced 'old-fashioned' novels with straightforward narratives that appealed to a popular audience's love of fantasy, adventure, sexuality and mystery. At an early age, she recognised that her readership was comprised principally of women, and she cultivated their loyal following through several decades by embodying their desires and dreams in her novels and short stories.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eIn some of her novels, however, she went beyond the technique of the formulaic romance to achieve a powerful psychological realism reflecting her intense feelings about her father, and to a lesser degree, her mother. This vision, which underlies \u003ci\u003eJulius\u003c/i\u003e, \u003ci\u003eRebecca\u003c/i\u003e and \u003ci\u003eThe Parasites\u003c/i\u003e, is that of an author overwhelmed by the memory of her father's commanding presence. In \u003ci\u003eJulius\u003c/i\u003e and \u003ci\u003eThe Parasites\u003c/i\u003e, for example, she introduces the image of a domineering but deadly father and the daring subject of incest.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eIn \u003ci\u003eRebecca\u003c/i\u003e, on the other hand, du Maurier fuses psychological realism with a sophisticated version of the Cinderella story. The nameless heroine has been saved from a life of drudgery by marrying a handsome, wealthy aristocrat, but unlike the Prince in Cinderella, Maxim de Winter is old enough to be the narrator's father. The narrator thus must do battle with The Other Woman—the dead Rebecca and her witch-like surrogate, Mrs Danvers—to win the love of her husband and father-figure.","isGrAuthor":false,"works":{"__typename":"ContributorWorksConnection","totalCount":273},"profileImageUrl":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/authors/1422444467i/2001717._UX200_CR0,50,200,200_.jpg","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2001717.Daphne_du_Maurier","user":null,"viewerIsFollowing":null,"followers":{"__typename":"ContributorFollowersConnection","totalCount":7097}},"Book:kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.7WFYef0-8I7hl31N771pfA":{"id":"kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.7WFYef0-8I7hl31N771pfA","__typename":"Book","legacyId":18869971,"webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18869971-the-scapegoat","title":"The Scapegoat","titleComplete":"The Scapegoat","description":"By chance, John and Jean--one English, the other French--meet in a provincial railway station.

only complaint with reading a Daphne du Maurier novel is that every book I pick up for some time afterwards pales in comparison. The depth of the characterizations, the richly described settings, and the undercurrent of suspense throughout never fail to enthrall me. No less so with this one, \u003cb\u003eThe Scapegoat\u003c/b\u003e. I found myself once again under du Maurier’s spell. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eJohn is an Englishman well-educated in everything French – the language, the history and the culture. He passes on all his knowledge as a lecturer at a university; he travels in France with ease. What he lacks, however, is a connection with the people. At the tail end of a tour in this country, John has fallen victim to a feeling of melancholy, of failure. He feels as an outsider, both in his own country of England as well as in France. He yearns to feel a part of the people, a kinship with his fellow human beings. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003e\"Years of study, years of training, the fluency with which I spoke their language, taught their history, described their culture, had never brought me closer to the people themselves. I was too diffident, too conscious of my own reserve. My knowledge was library knowledge, and my day-by-day experience no deeper than a tourist’s gleanings. The urge to know was with me, and the ache. The smell of the soil, the gleam of the wet roads, the faded paint of shutters masking windows through which I should never look, the grey faces of houses whose doors I should never enter, were to me an everlasting reproach, a reminder of distance, of nationality. Others could force an entrance and break the barrier down: not I. I should never be a Frenchman, never be one of them.\"\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAnyone that has ever hungered to be a part of a group, but yet always felt as a stranger, will relate to John here. What should happen, however, if you had the opportunity to take someone’s place? Would you do it? When John bumps into an exact likeness of himself in a tavern, he is given precisely this chance. While John is a lonely man with a feeling of emptiness inside, Comte Jean de Gué claims to have only the problem of having too many ‘human’ possessions. Jean wants to play a clever game – that of switching identities with John and assuming each other’s lives. When John wakes the next morning, stripped of his own clothes and everything he had on his person, what choice does he have but to put on another man’s clothes, take his suitcase and assume this new life? \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003e\"Just as an actor paints old lines upon a young face, or hides behind the part he must create, so the old anxious self that I knew too well could be submerged and forgotten, and the new self would be someone without a care, without responsibility, calling himself Jean de Gué... \"\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eIf only life were this simple. If only human relationships were straightforward, with little or no difficulties, no web of intricacies to disentangle. John, as the new Comte Jean de Gué, finds himself taking on a failing business and a family with secrets and complex feelings. John will come to know Jean through this family and his interactions with them. Jean may not be the kind of person our narrator would wish to emulate if given a choice. But isn’t he somehow responsible for these people now that he has allowed himself to be an accomplice to this deception? Does he want Jean to fail because he feels a victim in this charade? Perhaps John is Jean de Gué’s scapegoat, or maybe another is fulfilling this role in the drama that plays out in this wounded family. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eI was completely absorbed in this book. The psychological complexities and moral dilemmas, the Gothic-like atmosphere, and the superior writing that I have come to expect from Daphne du Maurier left me thoroughly satisfied. You really must read this if you have not. There’s so much more to this author than just her masterpiece, \u003cb\u003eRebecca\u003c/b\u003e, and you would be missing out if you didn’t immerse yourself in every last bit she had to offer – I know I will!\u003cbr /\u003e","rating":5,"shelving":{"__typename":"Shelving","shelf":{"__typename":"Shelf","name":"read","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/3639005?shelf=read"},"taggings":[{"__typename":"Tagging","tag":{"__typename":"Tag","name":"classics-shelf","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/3639005?shelf=classics-shelf"}},{"__typename":"Tagging","tag":{"__typename":"Tag","name":"mystery-crime","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/3639005?shelf=mystery-crime"}},{"__typename":"Tagging","tag":{"__typename":"Tag","name":"favorites","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/3639005?shelf=favorites"}},{"__typename":"Tagging","tag":{"__typename":"Tag","name":"book-i-own","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/3639005?shelf=book-i-own"}}],"webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1527416494"},"likeCount":245,"viewerHasLiked":null,"commentCount":79,"viewerCanComment({\"resourceType\":\"review\"})":null},"Book:kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.DoqlglH3hdY1puOj9TMgcA":{"id":"kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.DoqlglH3hdY1puOj9TMgcA","__typename":"Book"},"User:70395042":{"id":70395042,"__typename":"User","legacyId":70395042,"imageUrlSquare":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/users/1627838393i/70395042._UY200_CR33,0,200,200_.jpg","isAuthor":false,"textReviewsCount":785,"viewableName":"Fergus","isBlockedByViewer":false,"webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/70395042-fergus","contributor":null,"isFollowing":false,"isFriend":false,"followersCount":17507},"Review:kca://review:goodreads/amzn1.gr.review:goodreads.v1.QhdxnyAzEfebNQv31bcGWQ":{"id":"kca://review:goodreads/amzn1.gr.review:goodreads.v1.QhdxnyAzEfebNQv31bcGWQ","__typename":"Review","book":{"__ref":"Book:kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.DoqlglH3hdY1puOj9TMgcA"},"creator":{"__ref":"User:70395042"},"recommendFor":null,"updatedAt":1643737692241,"createdAt":1525741135499,"spoilerStatus":false,"lastRevisionAt":1643668225166,"text":"‘WHO KNOWS WHAT EVIL LURKS IN THE HEART OF MEN?’\u003cbr /\u003e‘The SHADOW Knows...’\u003cbr /\u003e(with assorted Backstage Evil Cackles)\u003cbr /\u003e- WWII-Era Radio Show.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eBack in the J.F.K.

Jean de Gue takes John to a restaurant....driving John's car ( after all, he knows it city best), and brings them to a shabby hotel.... and says \"Sometimes, these places can be useful\". \u003cbr /\u003eUSEFUL FOR WHAT??? \u003cbr /\u003eAfter the fourth drink....the men let down their guards more. \u003cbr /\u003eJohn continued to talk about loneliness, death, and the empty shell of his personal world. \u003cbr /\u003e Jean de Gue, master of a chateau, and director of a failing business says, \"You complain that your life is empty\", to me it sounds like paradise. An apartment to yourself, no family, no business worries\". \u003cbr /\u003eJean de Gue's voice changed - its clear he had personal problems too - felt resentment. He said he had a sister who only thinks about religion and nothing else. \u003cbr /\u003eHe thinks the only motive force in human nature is \"GREED\". People in Jean de Gue's life were never satisfied--[from his point of view]. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eSo... I ask: .... if you have read this far:\u003cbr /\u003e .....which of these two men's life sounds most attractive to you? Would you rather be without a family, with no responsibilities, but also feel lonely, depressed and empty? \u003cbr /\u003eOr, have many people counting on you - wife - mother - daughter - brother - sister-in-law- friends with benefits - business associates- and feel resentful? \u003cbr /\u003eAnd if you could step into one of these men's lives - by trading places --as a stranger/ actor taking over the role.... how do you think you might make a difference? And how might you do harm? In THIS story...we get the opportunity to watch how the entire scenario - this crazy game - so to speak - affects each person. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAs this story plays out ..... we watch how brilliantly John steps into Jean de Gue's life.....Funny transition scene - had to chuckle- a little! \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eJean de Gue had acted wrongly. He ran away from his life, he escaped the emotions that he himself created. John brought forth 'his' emotions - and whether right or wrong...( I think even the most skeptical readers can suspend disbelief, in this masterfully written fiction novel), .....I had faith that what John was searching for would somehow transform not only him but heal bruised family members with empathy and love. But how? And at what cost? \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eWhen John first stepped into Jean de Gue's life, he noticed that his mother looked frightened. His sister silent. His brother hostile. His sister-in-law angry. His wife crying, and his daughter threw a tantrum. The dog, ignored him. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThere are some \"OH BOY\" situations.... sticky as taffy! Also, this story is simply a \u003cbr /\u003ecompelling fantasy ride with marvelous prose to boot! \u003cbr /\u003eThe ending of this story calls for discussion!!! Personally -- I think it fits! \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eOff to join my group and read what others are saying! A book so much richer than many of the newer fiction books I often read. Just sayin! \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eA DELICIOUS BOOK!!!

What would happen if you suddenly had the chance to; would you \"grasp the nettle\"? Or what if a new life was imposed on you, whether you liked it or not? Such is the premise of Daphne du Maurier's 1957 novel, \u003cb\u003eThe Scapegoat.\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003eThe Scapegoat\u003c/b\u003e is reminiscent of novels such as, \u003ci\u003e\"The Prisoner of Zenda\"\u003c/i\u003e and according to one of Daphne du Maurier's biographers, this rollicking adventure was a favourite story of Daphne's when she was a little girl. But it also owes a great deal to \u003ci\u003e\"Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde\"\u003c/i\u003e as Daphne du Maurier also explores how two selves begin to feel as if they are part of the same person, the viewpoint character. In fact it is neither a straightforward adventure story as in Anthony Hope's tale, nor a dark study of two individuals; personalities within the same body, as in Robert Louis Stevenson's classic horror story. It lies somewhere between the two, yet is also an unsettling tale, full of suspense, sometimes even having a dream-like quality. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eDaphne du Maurier had the idea for \u003cb\u003eThe Scapegoat\u003c/b\u003e when she was in France in 1955, to research the lives of her ancestors, the Busson-Mathurins, who were glass-blowers. She did subsequently write the novel for which she intended this research, entitling it \u003ci\u003e\"The Glassblowers\"\u003c/i\u003e (1963). But before writing it, she became distracted by a number of incidents that happened to her in France, which inspired the plot of \u003cb\u003eThe Scapegoat\u003c/b\u003e, published in 1957. She apparently wrote it at record speed, finishing within six months, and then collapsed with nervous exhaustion.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eOne of the triggers was that while out for a walk in a square in a French town, Daphne du Maurier saw a man who looked identical to someone she happened to know. According to one of her biographers, Judith Cook, she then watched a family scene through a window, and began to put the two incidents together in her feverish imagination. Typically, she began to wonder about the people; who they were, and what their secrets might be, \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003e\"She imagined herself suddenly transported into their midst, listening to their conversation, perhaps even becoming one of them,\"\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eand so the seeds of \u003cb\u003eThe Scapegoat\u003c/b\u003e were sown.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAnother instance provides part of the novel's setting. Houses often seem to take on a life of their own in Daphne du Maurier's novels. For example, \u003ci\u003e\"Manderley\"\u003c/i\u003e in \u003ci\u003e\"Rebecca\"\u003c/i\u003e, seems to be imbued with as much of a presence - to be as much a character - as any of the actual people in the book. Indeed in her own life, she seems to have had an almost obsessive love for her \u003ci\u003e\"Menabilly\"\u003c/i\u003e the house she rented for so many years. Here in France, as part of her research, Daphne du Maurier discovered a house that had belonged to one of her ancestors two hundred years earlier. Exploring the derelict buildings, she saw fragments of the glass they had made, still there, scattered by the wind. She used these impressions and experiences, drawing on them to create an atmospheric, dramatic suspense novel, set in France. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eIn \u003cb\u003eThe Scapegoat\u003c/b\u003e, her ancestral glass-blowing foundry became the failing business of the de Gué family. They in turn were depicted as more grand, in fact minor aristocrats, the Comte and Comtesse. And instead of writing herself into the story, the author took on the guise of a male narrator, one of five occasions in major novels when she did this.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe narrator, and viewpoint character, is an Englishman named John. At the start of the novel we learnt that John is dissatisfied with his life as a university lecturer, and tending to become depressed with what he sees as a futile life. It is evident that he is travelling through France, where he meets a man who eerily is his double in looks; a confident French count, Jean de Gué. Intrigued despite himself, John plays along with the Count's wishes, indulging in a night of drinking, and staying in an anonymous downbeat hotel overnight. On waking, he discovers that the man has disappeared, taking all John's own clothes and belongings, and leaving him to play the role of the \"Comte Jean de Gué\". Thus we have the novel's basic premise.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAt first confused, John then becomes angry,\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003e\"filled with an intense desire to get away from that dingy, shabby hotel and never set eyes on it again, and as my anger rose and self-disgust took possession of me...\"\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAnd a little later, he describes being,\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003e\"possessed by a reckless feeling I had never known before, the sensation that I myself did not matter any more... no one could call me to account for any action. For the first time I was free.\"\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eHe thus become his double's scapegoat, and the events which follow enmesh him further in deceit and duplicity, which at first he considers to be in itself wrong, but quickly comes to regard as a means of basic survival, \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003e\"My sense of power was unbounded... I felt my bluff to be superb, and it must have worked... My self-confidence mounting every moment... I recalled my success the night before... little scraps of family history fell on my ear... what I gleaned would have to be sorted and sifted at leisure.\"\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eJohn learns about the idiosyncratic family he has been thrust amidst. He learns how his doppelgänger had influenced the destinies of these individuals, mercilessly twisting their lives to his own purpose. Gradually John begins to feel sympathy for the family who have accepted him, John, totally at face value. They have treated him variously with the emotions he has seemed to lack in his life so far; that is with love or hatred, but rarely with indifference. And as the novel proceeds we become aware that John has become emotionally committed to this family, within the space of seven days. He determines to use his family position as a tool, to influence both the workers in the factory, and \"his\" individual family member's lives for the better. Although a scapegoat, he is desperate to learn everything about the family intrigues, deceptions, jealousies and murders, both the events in the past and also those in the present.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eIndeed there are at least two other contenders for the description of \"scapegoat\". Either the daughter or the wife could be seen in these terms. Marie-Noel seems over-eager to sacrifice herself for her father, as does Françoise, the Count's wife. The intensity of the little girl Marie-Noel's relationship with her father is clearly a reflection of that between the author, Daphne du Maurier, and her own father, the charismatic actor-manager Gerald du Maurier. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eBut Daphne du Maurier's descriptions of the little girl's religious fervour, as well as that of her aunt Blanche, serve well to heighten the tension at various points. It borders on the macabre, and makes the novel seem almost a gothic tale. All Daphne du Maurier's novels are tightly plotted, and this one, like \u003ci\u003e\"My Cousin Rachel\"\u003c/i\u003e is full of suspense, coincidence, hints and dark secrets. The narrator continually suspects various members of his family - including his doppelgänger - of not only duplicity, but also of some evil deeds in the past. The whole novel is driven by the narrator's desperate desire for knowledge and understanding. He never reflects back on what has led him to this point, or what his life has been so far, but always concentrates on remaining undiscovered, and as the novel proceeds, on influencing the future of his \"adopted family\" for their good.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAs with many of Daphne du Maurier's novels, there are so many elements of mystery that it is sometimes rather like reading a detective story. She often drops hints to the reader; clues carefully planted so that the reader is able to puzzle out the various roles and relationships before the viewpoint character John does. We suspect Renée's behaviour, for example, before John seems to have an inkling of why she seems so overly flirtatious and petulant. And we know who the woman Béla in the neighbouring village of Villars must be.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eWe see as the novel proceeds, a merging of the two John/Jeans,\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003e\"The feeling of power, of triumph that I was outwitting this little group of unsuspecting people had turned again to shame. It seemed to me now that I wanted Jean de Gué to have been a different sort of man. I did not want to discover at each step that he was worthless... I had exchanged my own negligible self for a worthless personality. He had the supreme advantage over me in that he had not cared. Or had he, after all? Was this why he had disappeared?\"\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAnd later,\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003e\"I knew that everything I had said or done had implicated me further, driven me deeper, bound me more closely still to that man whose body was not my body, whose mind was not my mind, whose thoughts and actions were a world apart, and yet whose inner substance was part of my nature, part of my secret self.\"\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAt this point just less than half-way through, the dream-like quality is notched up a step, and we realise that John is beginning to perceive another, darker, personality hidden within his own self, much as the character \u003ci\u003e\"Doctor Jekyll\"\u003c/i\u003e did, but more subtly. Although Jekyll became subsumed and ultimately destroyed by the malignant influence of Hyde, John conversely seems to become more self-possessed and confident through his exploration of his darker self. He seems to become, in a sense, a more complete character, and his past a mere shadow.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThere are recurring themes in this novel. Take the motif of a broken ornament, for instance. In \u003ci\u003e\"Rebecca\"\u003c/i\u003e, the episode where the new wife accidentally destroys a valuable china ornament given to her predecessor (Rebecca) on her marriage, and becoming a particular favourite, is powerfully symbolic. Here there is a similar event involving Anne-Marie and her mother, and a porcelain cat and dog,\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003e\"the only things I possess and value in this house.\"\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eReal-life dogs are another device. There are heart-stopping moments where the readers wonder whether the dog will recognise the supplanted character of John, in the place of César's master, the Count. In \u003ci\u003e\"Rebecca\"\u003c/i\u003e, the dog is suspicious for a long time of the new wife. In both cases the apprehension devolves on the viewpoint character. When César, the dog, finally accepts John, the author says,\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003e\"as he wagged his tail, I felt that I had scored a triumph.\"\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe writing style too, feels very like Daphne du Maurier's other novels. There is much description to add colour and mood. On quite a few occasions she will use personification, or even the pathetic fallacy, to influence and further heighten the atmosphere, such as when,\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003e\"There was no break in the weeping sky to give direction.\"\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAt one point halfway through the novel, John feels that he is trapped in a corner. He feels impotent, and that whatever he does will not work; he is sinking further and further into a morass of his own making. The author describes the scene outside the house, \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003e\"Immediately beside me was a gargoyle's head, ears flattened, slits for eyes, the jutting lips forming a spout for rain. The leaded guttering was choked with leaves, and when rain came the whole would turn to mud and pour from the gargoyle's mouth in a turbid stream... seeping down the walls, swirling in the runways, choking and gurgling above the gargoyle head, driving sideways like arrows to the windows, stinging the panes... there would be no other sound for hour after hour... but the falling rain, and the flood of leaves and rubble through the gargoyle's mouth.\"\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eOn another occasion, when the reader is finally about to learn the truth about the mysterious Maurice Duval,\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003e\"A fluttering sound by the window made me turn my head. It was a butterfly, the last of the long summer, woken by sunshine, seeking escape from the cobwebs that imprisoned it. I released the butterfly from its prison, and it hovered a moment on the sill, then settled once more amongst the cobwebs.\"\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe novel hurtles to its conclusion, within its short compressed time-frame, as John desperately tries to right the wrongs as he sees them. Increasingly he is more committed, yet contrarily also more unsure,\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003e\"I wondered how much further I had to fall, and if the sense of shame that overwhelmed me was merely wallowing in darkness... I had played the coward long enough.\"\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eWhen the dog, César, drags him at reckless speed through the woods, it is as if John's own darker side is \"dogging\" him,\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003e\"I dragged myself to my feet, and with my hell-hound in tow started off once more through the vastness of the wood, feeling, as the poet did before me, that my companion would be with me through the nights and through the days, and down the arches of the years, and I should never be rid of him.\"\u003c/i\u003e \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eEven the structure of this one sentence gives the impression of hurtling towards doom. It does not let up; there is no break.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eTowards the conclusion, the identification, or perhaps the confusion or melding of the two characters John/Jean, becomes ever more apparent. Here John refers to an event long past, but seems to also draws truths from it about his doppelgänger, \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003e\"I knew that what had happened on a dark night nearly fifteen years ago had not come about by chance but was something planned and done deliberately by a man without heart or feeling, who saw perhaps, in the other someone finer than himself possessing... all the qualities he himself lacked.\"\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eYet he still fears discovery,\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003e\"...she knows at last. I've given myself away... But I was wrong.\"\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\"I could not ask forgiveness for something I had not done. As scapegoat I could only bear the fault.\"\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eOn the penultimate page, the transmogrification is complete,\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003e\"I walked on through darkness, undergrowth and moss, and now I had no present and no past, the self who stumbled had no heart and mind...\"\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\"wishing to condemn him, it was as if it was the shadow I condemned, the man who had moved and spoken and acted in his place, and not Jean de Gué at all. \u003cbr /\u003e\"It's no use... I'm not describing the man you know.\"\u003cbr /\u003e\"You are... but you're describing yourself as well.\"\u003cbr /\u003eThere was the fear. Which one of us was real?... It struck me suddenly that if I should now look at myself in a mirror I should see no reflection.\"\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThis is a disturbing tale, and it comes as no surprise to learn how emotionally drained and disturbed the author was on its completion. Events in Daphne du Maurier's own life were mirrored within the novel, and the author became increasingly jittery and confused as to which had actually happened first. When she wrote about the character Françoise needing a blood transfusion, in real life shortly afterwards, her daughter Tessa gave birth to a son who needed two blood transfusions. Her biographer Judith Cook says, of the odd coincidences and connections,\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003e\"Daphne began to find it all rather frightening.\"\u003c/i\u003e \u003cbr /\u003e \u003cbr /\u003eAnd another biographer, Margaret Forster, reprints a letter, which Daphne du Maurier wrote in the same year of \u003cb\u003eThe Scapegoat\u003c/b\u003e's publication, 1957, just after her (Daphne's) husband Tommy had had a nervous breakdown. She herself was also on the verge of nervous collapse. In it, she talks about her novel, \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003e\"It is my story, and it is [his] also. We are both doubles. So it is with everyone. Every one of us has his, or her, dark side. Which is to overcome the other? This is the purpose of the book. And it ends, as you know, with the problem unsolved, except that the suggestion there, when I finished it, was that the two sides of that man's nature had to fuse together to give birth to a third, well balanced.

It provides neither the delicious twist we have learnt to expect from this author, nor the massive ambiguity she can do so well. Clearly from this letter though, it is what she intended, and perhaps had to wrestle with internally herself. Perhaps after all it is a fitting ending to a novel, in which she delved into John/Jean's - and possibly her own - psyche and explored other, imaginary selves. Did she explore mere fantasies, or their secret lives?

Teacher John Standing, who has just lost his job, meets his doppelgänger Johnny Spence, a failed businessman.

Better yet, trade places with my dog, Zelda.

Time for the old switcheroo?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJohn, our narrator, is a lonely academic, someone who always felt like an observer rather than a participant in life. Jean, on the other hand, describes himself as a \"family man\" who evidently doesn't enjoy the title and is only too happy to jump ship.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe story follows John, who tries his best to live his doppelgänger's life without making too many missteps or being discovered as a fraud. Turns out, the life he is to assume is a complicated one. Suddenly, he's a man with a depressed wife, a crumbling chateau, a failing glass foundry, a mistress in town, a mistress in the house, a sister who hasn't spoken to him in fifteen years, a troubled daughter and mysteriously ill mother. Plus a dark history that no one dares to speak of.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJohn is truly a scapegoat, held responsible for acts committed by another man:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci\u003eI could not ask for forgiveness for something I had not done. As scapegoat, I could only bear the fault.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere's a fair amount of suspension of disbelief that is required on the part of the reader, but du Maurier is so skilled at engaging us, there were very few times that I stopped or scratched my head. I was only too happy to be along for the ride. The way she slowly reveals information is well timed, a natural unfolding.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne thing I noticed and found surprising is that the book is less gothic than the other novels of hers that I've read (\u003ci\u003eRebecca\u003c/i\u003e, \u003ci\u003eMy Cousin Rachel\u003c/i\u003e). There are fewer of the traditional gothic tropes on display (the house as a main character, ghosts or dead who preoccupy the minds of the characters, letters received from people long dead, animals who meet bad ends, dark eroticism). I'd say this book is more of a mystery, if I had to classify it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe ending is also surprising - I didn't see it coming. Again, less gothic, but satisfying (although I must say, it left me quite curious as to what followed the final page). In the end, it's another spellbinding story woven by a truly gifted writer. A story that examines identity and fate in a thoughtful way, written in the author's elegant but provoking pen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(I still want to trade places with Zelda, by the way.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1610318840i/30675787._SY540_.jpg\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\"\u003e","rating":5,"shelving":{"__typename":"Shelving","shelf":{"__typename":"Shelf","name":"read","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/36555254?shelf=read"},"taggings":[{"__typename":"Tagging","tag":{"__typename":"Tag","name":"mystery","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/36555254?shelf=mystery"}},{"__typename":"Tagging","tag":{"__typename":"Tag","name":"english","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/36555254?shelf=english"}},{"__typename":"Tagging","tag":{"__typename":"Tag","name":"2021","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/36555254?shelf=2021"}}],"webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3222870493"},"likeCount":120,"viewerHasLiked":null,"commentCount":53,"viewerCanComment({\"resourceType\":\"review\"})":null},"User:14233569":{"id":14233569,"__typename":"User","legacyId":14233569,"imageUrlSquare":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/users/1479858526i/14233569._UX200_CR0,0,200,200_.jpg","isAuthor":false,"textReviewsCount":357,"viewableName":"Mary Beth ","isBlockedByViewer":false,"webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14233569-mary-beth","contributor":null,"isFollowing":false,"isFriend":false,"followersCount":1420},"Review:kca://review:goodreads/amzn1.gr.review:goodreads.v1.gIUBraViA6aDe3NtBGnyVg":{"id":"kca://review:goodreads/amzn1.gr.review:goodreads.v1.gIUBraViA6aDe3NtBGnyVg","__typename":"Review","book":{"__ref":"Book:kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.7WFYef0-8I7hl31N771pfA"},"creator":{"__ref":"User:14233569"},"recommendFor":null,"updatedAt":1612854561532,"createdAt":1486416834297,"spoilerStatus":false,"lastRevisionAt":1486416884788,"text":" 4.5 stars\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e I have read several of Daphne Du Maurier's books and loved every single one.

That's what happens to John, an Englishman on holiday in France, when he meets his exact double - a Frenchman called Jean de Gue. John agrees to go for a drink with Jean but falls into a drunken stupor and wakes up in a hotel room to find that Jean has disappeared, taking John's clothes and identity documents with him!\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eWhen Jean's chauffeur arrives at the hotel, John is unable to convince him of what has happened - and ends up accompanying the chauffeur to Jean de Gue's chateau, where the Frenchman's unsuspecting family assume that he really is Jean de Gue. Naturally, they expect him to continue running the family glass-making business and arranging shooting parties - things that John has absolutely no experience in. Before long, it starts to become obvious that Jean is using John as a scapegoat; Jean's family and business are both in a mess and he wants someone else to have to deal with them.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThroughout the book, I was forced to revise my opinions once or twice about what was really going on. If everything in the book is supposed to be taken literally, then we need to suspend belief at times: could two men really be so identical that even their mother, wife and daughter can't tell the difference? There is also another way to interpret the story, one which goes deeper into the psychology of identity - I won't say any more about that here, but if you read the book this theory may occur to you too. I found the book very thought provoking.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAs usual, du Maurier's writing is wonderfully atmospheric. She has a way of making you feel as though you're actually there in the hotel room in Le Mans, the grounds of Jean de Gue's estate in the French countryside and Bela's antique shop in the town of Villars.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eWhen John first arrives at the de Gue chateau, every member of the household is a stranger to him but we (and John) are given enough clues to gradually figure out who each person is and what their relationship is to Jean de Gue. From the neglected pregnant wife and the hostile elder sister to the resentful younger brother and the religious ten-year-old daughter, every character is well-drawn and memorable.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAnother thing I love about Daphne du Maurier's writing is her ability to always keep the reader guessing right to the final page (and sometimes afterwards too).

I thought I knew how it was going to end…Dame du Maurier it appeared to me was right near the end leading me and other readers down the primrose path to the denouement. Not so fast. 😮\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eI had read two other books by Dame Daphne du Maurier and very much liked them: Rebecca (1938) and My Cousin Rachel (1951). I had never heard of this book (originally published in 1957) BUT SEE BELOW …until several months ago it got a favorable review from a GR friend. So I put it on my TBR list…got it from the library and devoured it in one day. The edition I got was by the University of Pennsylvania Press, and it was already in its 5th printing. I wonder why a university press would be publishing Daphne du Maurier…on the back cover it was stated that The House on the Strand was also available via the university press. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe basic plot is that a Frenchman in his early 40s runs into another man, an Englishman in his early 40s, who is a body double of him (doppelgänger). By clever means and not to his liking the Englishman finds himself forced to impersonate the Frenchman and inherits the Frenchman’s life and family…a brother and a sister and a mother and they’re all messed up to varying degrees, and a wife, and she is unhappy because her husband has been essentially ignoring her and only married her for a potential buttload of money if she produces a son for him (complicated legal arrangement regarding her dowry). Oh and that’s just the beginning…he inherits a precocious 11-year old daughter, a sister-in-law (who he is having an affair with), a valet, a mistress, a glass factory that is floundering… And given this is a du Maurier novel there have been sinister things happening well into the past…that this Englishman now fake Frenchman is going to have to deal with. Perhaps vaguely reminiscent of ‘Heaven Can Wait’, a film from the late 1970s starring Warren Beatty and Julie Christie (and a gaggle of other good actors)…although that was a comedy/love story when push comes to shove. Not a whole lot to laugh at in this novel. In fact nothing really. \u003cbr /\u003eWhich doesn’t mean this novel is not good — I think it’s pretty damn good. And I am glad I read it. 😊\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eIt held my interest pretty much throughout, although maybe about two-thirds of the way through my interest flagged but then accelerated again — just a minor bump in the road. Otherwise I think I would have rated it as ‘5’ rather than ‘4’…but in my rating system a ‘4’ is “a memorable read and if there is anything else the author has written I would be quite interested in it”, thank you very much.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e😢\u003cbr /\u003eI just looked at an Excel database I have kept for some 15 years or so and have discovered I read this in 2001. How could I forget reading this book??? It’s like I read it for the first time today! In fact you can see from my review above I was assuming this was the first tine I had laid eyes on this book. I know some books are certainly worth reading two times…but yeesh. Maybe I should be taking a buttload of Prevogen. After all, it contains an ingredient found in jellyfish. Or so the ad says…I wonder if jellyfish have good memories? Apparently they have better memories than I.🤨\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eReviews:\u003cbr /\u003eFrom a blog site: \u003ca target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" href=\"https://thelitedit.com/the-scapegoat-daphne-du-maurier/\"\u003ehttps://thelitedit.com/the-scapegoat-...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eFrom a sci-fi newsletter (a very good review): \u003ca target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" href=\"https://www.tor.com/2010/09/12/youre-not-the-devil-by-any-chance-daphne-du-mauriers-the-scapegoat/\"\u003ehttps://www.tor.com/2010/09/12/youre-...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ca target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" href=\"https://www.literaryladiesguide.com/book-description/scapegoat-1956-daphne-dumaurier-2/\"\u003ehttps://www.literaryladiesguide.com/b...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThis was made into a movie in 1959 starring Alec Guinness and Bette Davis.
