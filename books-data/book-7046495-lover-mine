among humans, his vampire nature unknown to himself and to those around him. After he was taken in by the Brotherhood, no one could guess what his true history was- or his true identity. Indeed, the fallen Brother Darius has returned, but with a different face and a very different destiny. As a vicious personal vendetta takes John into the heart of the war, he will need to call up on both who he is now and who he once was in order to face off against evil incarnate.<br /><br />Xhex, a symphath assassin, has long steeled herself against the attraction between her and John Matthew. Having already lost one lover to madness, she will not allow the male of worth to fall prey to the darkness of her twisted life. When fate intervenes, however, the two discover that love, like destiny, is inevitable between soul mates.</span></div></div></div></div><div data-testid="genresList" class="BookPageMetadataSection__genres"><ul class="CollapsableList" aria-label="Top genres for this book"><span class="BookPageMetadataSection__genre"><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/genres/paranormal" class="Button Button--tag-inline Button--medium"><span class="Button__labelItem">Paranormal</span></a></span> <span class="BookPageMetadataSection__genre"><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/genres/paranormal-romance" class="Button Button--tag-inline Button--medium"><span class="Button__labelItem">Paranormal Romance</span></a></span> <span class="BookPageMetadataSection__genre"><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/genres/romance" class="Button Button--tag-inline Button--medium"><span class="Button__labelItem">Romance</span></a></span> <span class="BookPageMetadataSection__genre"><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/genres/vampires" class="Button Button--tag-inline Button--medium"><span class="Button__labelItem">Vampires</span></a></span> <div class="Button__container"><button type="button" class="Button Button--tag-inline Button--medium" aria-label="Show all items in the list"><span class="Button__labelItem">...more</span></button></div></ul></div><div class="BookDetails"><div class="CollapsableList"><span class="Text Text__body3"><div class="FeaturedDetails"><p data-testid="pagesFormat">528 pages, Hardcover</p><p data-testid="publicationInfo">First published April 27, 2010</p><p data-testid="awards"><span class="CollapsableList"><span data-testid="award"><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/award/show/405-all-about-romance-aar-annual-reader-poll">All About Romance (AAR) Annual Reader Poll</a>, Guiltiest Pleasure Romance &amp; Honorable Mention for Best Paranormal Romance<span class="Text Text__subdued"> (2011)</span></span>, <span data-testid="award"><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/award/show/899-romantic-times-reviewers-choice-award-rt-award">Romantic Times Reviewers&#x27; Choice Award (RT Award)</a> Nominee<!-- -->, Vampire Romance<span class="Text Text__subdued"> (2010)</span></span>, <span data-testid="award"><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/award/show/21332-goodreads-choice-award">Goodreads Choice Award</a>, Romance<span class="Text Text__subdued"> (2010)</span></span></span></p></div></span> <div class="Button__container"><button type="button" class="Button Button--inline Button--small" aria-label="Show more book details"><span class="Button__labelItem">More details</span></button></div></div></div><hr class="Divider" role="presentation"/><div class="AuthorPreview"><div class="AuthorPreview__profile"><div class="AuthorPreview__avatar"><a class="Avatar Avatar--large" href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/20248.J_R_Ward" as="div"><img data-testid="image" class="Avatar__image" alt="J.R.

class="TruncatedText"><div class="TruncatedText__text TruncatedText__text--5" data-testid="contentContainer"><div><span class="Formatted"><i>Some things are destined to be-<br />It just takes us a couple of tries<br />to get there.</i><br /><br />Lover Mine is the eighth book in the Black Dagger Brotherhood series. It’s about second chances. About circumstances and relationships coming full circle. About revenge, trust, friendship and love. But most importantly: it’s about John Matthew. <br /><br />John Matthew, aka Darius reincarnated, is undoubtedly one of the most popular characters in the series. When we meet him in Lover Eternal, he’s a scrawny little mute who lives in a run down apartment and carries a big secret with him. In Lover Mine he has turned into a beautiful vampire male with a warrior body, who lives with the King of his race and fights with the Black Dagger Brotherhood. <br />Warrior body or not, inside John Matthew feels small, empty and out of place. He wants to belong to someone and his object of affection is Xhex.<br /><br />Now Xhex must be one of the most controversial characters of the series. With her athletic body, her strong features, her men’s haircut and her tough as nails attitude, she’s hardly your typical romance heroine. But there’s much more than meets the eye to Xhex and John is drawn to her like a moth to a flame.<br /><br />To me, the great thing about John and Xhex’s relationship is that it has been running for a couple of books. We experienced their initial awkwardness, followed by sexual tension, tentative trust and full on implosion. Lover Mine finally gives them their HEA. But to accomplish this they need to overcome the burdens of the past and learn to truly trust each other. <br /><br />Unlike previous books, the love story had a prominent role in this one. In previous editions, the secondary plots set up a back story for the next books. This book introduced a few new characters but pretty much left it at that. <br />The focus was on love and closure. John and Xhex got a truly wonderful love story which turned out to be of epic proportions due to Darius’ involvement. Their scenes were emotional, exciting, heartbreaking and scorching hot and these two characters ended up being much more alike than anyone would have thought. <br />The secondary plot which also focused on love was about the relationship between Qhuinn and Blay. Oh… the tension! The mixed and missed signals! The angst! It was really hard to bear and many times left me on the edge of my seat or screaming “noohoooo” to the book. <br /><br />Another great thing about Lover Mine was the villain: Lash. Lash truly is the best thing that ever happened to the lessers. He single-handedly changed the lesser scenes from boring and skip-worthy to exciting, not to miss, sometimes hilarious. He is bad with a vengeance but he’s engaging and interesting and funny. <br /><br />After all this raving and the 5 star rating you would think I found this book to be absolutely perfect, but sadly: no. There were many things, small and big which irked me. <br /><br />First of all: the fashion in which Murhder’s character was introduced left a lot to be desired. The whole story about the camera crew seemed redundant and Murhder didn’t leave a good enough impression to be even considered interesting. <br /><br />Another story line was a flashback about Darius. Since this book is about closure and looking to the future, I (and everyone with me) had expected a final moment in where the JM/Darius connection would come out in the open… or to an end…. or would transition or…. anything! But no. The way this situation was resolved -or not resolved- was really anticlimactic. <br /><br />There were lots of loose threads throughout the book. Things being said or mentioned, never to be picked up later on. Too many things happened in the last 20 pages which made the ending seemed hastily wrapped up and unfinished. <br />There were also quite some inconsistencies. The timeline didn’t make much sense, characters disappeared for short parts of the scenes and popped up in the end, characters who had a relation before did not talk at all (Ehlena and Xhex), etc. <br />Certain situations defied all logic: like Xhex not having seen John’s tattoo till pretty much the end of the book, despite all their wild love making. Or Xhex being able to follow a rant in ASL after she’d just learned to spell the alphabet… and then have JM sign slowly to her the next day. <br /><br />So there was some seriously sloppy writing going on (please Ms Ward, find yourself a new editor!) and for a book that is about closure, too many questions were left unanswered. And that makes me sad because there’s no guarantee that they will be answered in the next book and not be forgotten.<br /><br />Another thing which makes me sad is that this book seems to mark the end of an era. <br />Much has changed throughout the books but John Matthew’s narrating was a constant factor which saw us readers through the series. It was wonderful to see the world through his eyes but now that he got his own book, I’m very much afraid that we will lose him.<br />I'm still holding out hope though... because of this dedication from Ward to John Matthew in the beginning of the book: <br /><br /><i>I cannot believe you and I have come so far<br />Your book is not a goodbye, however-<br />just another beginning<br />But you’re used to that…</i><br /><br />Overall: a good book, 4,5 out 5. But John Matthew deserved a full 5. </span></div></div></div></section></section><section class="ReviewCard__tags"><ul class="CollapsableList"><a

If it's even possible, I probably love them twenty times more now. <br /><br />The WARDen is so good at writing stories about human nature, all the weaknesses, the vulnerabilities, the strengths. How, at the end of the day, all of us just want to feel special, to feel loved. And when we don't feel that, how it has the power to destroy us.<br /><br />John Matthew had the worst start in life possible. He was born in a bathroom stall in a bus station. He was born without the ability to talk. He was horribly assaulted at a young age. He had no one to love him. And just when life started turning around, he lost two people he loved very much. And then he met Xhex. From the beginning, she was the one for him. No one can explain what causes us to fall in love with someone. You can call it hormones, fate, destiny, attraction, random coincidence. There is no concrete way to rationalize it. I for one, felt that pull between them. I knew it was going to be big and life-changing for them both. JM fell apart, big time in Lover Avenged. It was very painful to read, and his actions made me so angry. But, I realized that he had been driven to his breaking point, and he was acting out of complete despair. So, it was really good to see him pull himself together so he could save Xhex. And boy, did he! Oh, could John be a more worthy male? I don't think so. He's so sweet, but so strong. He has a protective instinct, but at the same time, he embraced Xhex's strength, and didn't try to change what made her the woman he loved. He came from nothing, but is full of so much. The WARDen made me fall in love with JM all over again.<br /><br />I was so glad that the WARDen took a big, huge chance with crafting a heroine like Xhex. There are a lot of Xhex haters out there in the Black Dagger Brotherhood fandom. They have said some really ugly things about her. It bothers me, because Xhex is such a great character in my opinion. She has so much going on inside of her. She is so strong, yet she has the things that define a woman in my opinion. Some people think she's too manly or not feminine enough. If she can be who she is and have a man like JM totally in love with her, I say sign me up for her version of manly. I say that in a half-serious manner. But with all seriousness, if Xhex had not been the strong woman, the fierce warrior that she is, she would not have survived what she's been through in her life. She lived in a dark, bleak world, with little to support her. She had to be a strong person, to build a fortress around her inner self, or she would have been decimated. And had she been any less fortified, Lash would have destroyed her. It's pretty clear that I adore Xhex. I think she's sexy, beautiful, loving, intense, intelligent, empathetic, formidable, intriguing, the list goes on. She is now my favorite heroine ever. I felt she was the perfect complement to John. It gratified me that Tohr could see it, from the beginning. I didn't need the backstory of Xhex to love her, but I love her even more now. I didn't need to see her as vulnerable and broken as she was in this book to respect and love her. But, seeing her that way, well it just made the happy ending that much better. <br /><br />I couldn't have written the ending better. It's like JR Ward took my wish list for Xhex and JM's story and wrote this book based on it. Oh, there were some really hard moments, but I kept the faith that things would work out for them, and boy was I rewarded. I finished this book yesterday morning, and I had to go and reread some of my favorite scenes. The interaction between John and Xhex was so powerful, it turned my heart to mush. The steamy moments really made up for the hurtful interactions they had in Lover Avenged. How unfulfilling their intimate moments were in that book. Their love scenes set my book on fire and singed my hands. Boy, this couple has some chemistry. But, even better, their love for each other had the power to heal them both. Verily, this book makes me believe in true love, and that there is someone for everyone. <br /><br />Even though I'd love this book enough to light up a solar system just based on the JM/Xhex story, the other aspects also made it a wonderful read for me. The Qhuinn/Blay story line has progressed in a very good fashion. I was so happy to get more of Blay's viewpoint. Blay is dear to my heart. I love that male. It tore me up to see how much his love for Qhuinn was hurting him. Qhuinn had his heart, but he didn't know what to do with it, so he kept throwing it back. And Blay seemed to have no way to get away from his feelings for Blay. So I was glad to see Saxton come into his life. Saxton is one fine male. I liked him from the beginning. He is just what Blay needs. I'm not sure how long they'll be together, but it's good for now. Qhuinn showed some aspects of his character that I needed to see. I have to admit that I did feel for him, and his low self-worth because of being rejected by his family, but I didn't like his lifestyle. I didn't like how he was acting like he was blind to Blay's love for him, and how it hurt Blay for him to sleep with everyone <b>but</b> Blay. I realize that Qhuinn thinks he's not good enough for Blay, but he seemed oblivious to the way he was hurting Blay. I was surprised at how much it hurt to see Qhuinn hurt because Blay had moved on with Saxton. I thought I'd be gratified because he'd know how Blay felt all the time. But, it was so sad for me to read about, because Qhuinn had the opportunity to have Blay, but he was afraid to take the step. And how that must break Qhuinn's heart. I have hopes that things will work out for them, but right now, it's a painful journey. I do think that Qhuinn is going to take a step in a better direction in the forthcoming books. And Blay will get some love and affection like he needs, although his heart will always belong to Qhuinn. I definitely feel for the Qhuinn/Blay fans right now.<br /><br />I loved the parts in the past showing Darius and Tohr's relationship. It really explained why Tohr took on JM as a son, because Darius had done the same for him. Darius and Tohr are such fine males. You can see how they helped shape and form the foundation for the Brotherhood that we see today. Tohr always came off as an admirable, honorable man that I cared for, but I have grown to love him even more. My heart is broken for his loss. I can completely understand how it nearly destroyed him. I was so glad to see him on the mend, and to see him and John Matthew come to terms. That close bond that was ripped apart by Wellsie's death has evolved into something very wonderful, as JM comes to see exactly how Tohr felt, and Tohr is able to understand why Xhex is so important to JM. And it feels to good to know that Torh approves of Xhex for JM.<br /><br />There were some really great Doc Jane moments. Her expertise as a doctor, but her understanding of people and how to help them deal with illness was a very important part of this book, as she interacted with Xhex in the aftermath of her captivity with Lash, and also with Xhex's fear of hospitals. <br /><br />I won't even pretend like this BDB fan girl didn't have some joy-joy moments seeing the other characters. Wow, it was pretty interesting seeing how the backstory with Butch and Xhex, and Vishous' animosity towards Xhex was dealt with. And of course, my smooth criminal, Rehvenge, was in this book enough to encourage me to reread his story again. What a man! I love his relationship with Xhex. And the Shadow brothers, Trez and iAm, have some good moments in this story, as well. <br /><br />Payne's role expands in this book, and I could see the WARDen setting the stage for her book. Part of me sort of feared that this book would be the penultimate culmination of my love for this series, and it would go downhill, but I have a feeling that WARDen is just getting started. Payne is one heck of an interesting character. And her story is sure to enthrall me, based on how things unfold in this book.<br /><br />And, can I say that Murhder has this fan reaching for the cold drinks? I can tell he's going to rock my world. I hope to see a lot more of this male!<br /><br />I cannot do this review without talking about Lash. There are some pretty good words to describe him, but I don't want to be a potty-mouth. He is a perfect contrast to JM in almost every way. He was born with everything and threw it away. His heart is completely rotten, whereas JM couldn't have more goodness in his heart. The fact that he takes and harms the person that JM loves most in the world seemed almost fated, as they come face to face in a conflict that started when they were both soldier trainees. I have to say that he turned out to be a very good villain. I wasn't sure what to think about how the storyline with Lash ended. It needed to go the way it did. But I can't help feeling that there is more to be told on that front. But then, that's one of the things that I love about this series. The way the WARDen plants seeds in my consciousness, and I have questions that make me want to delve deeper into these books. More things for this BDB addict to ponder. Sadly, these characters and this world is frighteningly real to me. Is there a twelve step program for Black Dagger Brotherhood addiction? But then, even if there is a cure, I'm not sure I want it!<br /><br />This book, oh, this book. I can't say how much I loved this latest installment in the Black Dagger Brotherhood series. You know someone needs help when they start tearing up as they write a review. I am freaking hopeless when it comes to this series and this book. It made my dreams come true, but it also took me to some dark places. It makes me ponder fate, and how the ties between others are so convoluted, yet tightly wound, bringing us together and challenging us in ways we don't ever get to understand. This review will be too long if I keep saying everything I want to say. There is just too much to put into words. But I will say four words to Ms. Ward: Thank you so much!!!! And I'll say it twice: Thank you so much!!!</span></div></div></div></section></section><section class="ReviewCard__tags"><ul class="CollapsableList"><a

</a><br><br><b>As she waited for Lash to come back to her, her mind drifted to the male she tried never to think of. Especially if Lash was around. It was unclear how much her captor could get into her head, but she didn't want to take chances. If the bastard got an itch that that mute soldier was her well-of-soul, as her people called it, he would use that against her... and John Matthew.-Xhex</b><br><br>First read 2014<br>Reread 4/5/2017<br><br><b>Spoilers</b><br><br>OMG John Matthew and Xhex....... God I fucking loved them! Their story was so powerful and emotional and....just damn beautiful. I was really looking forward to John and Xhex's story as I felt really invested in them. This book was everything I wanted and more. As John and Xhex's story unfolded I was a total wreck. My emotions were all over the place. One minute I was smiling, then I was laughing, then crying, then aching, and swooning my ass off. J.R. Ward is amazing in the way she can write these epic love stories that touch so many people. As one of those people all I can say is Thank You. These books give me such joy and live in my heart long after I read the last page. <br><br><a href="http://s327.photobucket.com/user/jessica_hatfield1/media/tumblr_o00pivDKpL1u9jwwwo1_400_zpsc3lpfris.gif.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">

</a><br><br><b>"No, you've got it all wrong, John." Reading his emotions, she shook her head. "You're not half the male you could be because of what was done to you. You're twice what anyone else is because you survived."-Xhex</b><br><br>John was damn sexy and utterly wonderful. The way he was with Xhex so caring, and supportive. Always putting her first. Very protective, but he never tried to change Xhex. He knew he was in love with a fighter and he didn't disrespect her by acting like she couldn't take care of herself. One of the things I loved the most about John Matthew was even though he was totally kick ass, he had this vulnerable side. His being mute and having been raped when he was a pretran in no way made him weaker they made him stronger, a survivor. John is my second favorite hero of the series. Xhex was also completely amazing. A total bad ass in her own right, she kicked ass and didn't bother with names. So it was heartbreaking and emotional to see her hurt, violated, and helpless. What I love is that she never gave up. A fighter til the end she fought with everything she had. I also loved how soft she was with John Matthew and John Matthew only. She let him in, let her guard down with him. It was cute how he brought out her girly side to a point. She was still kick ass Xhex, but still the softness was very endearing. <br><br><b>" Oh, John..." And then he stopped dead, lifted his lips from her nipple, and smiled so wide it was a wonder he didn't bust off his front teeth. His expression was one of total and complete gotcha. " You are a bastard, " she said on a laugh. He nodded. And pressed into her with his full length again. It was perfect that he was giving her shit and showing her a little of who was boss. Just perfect. Somehow it made her respect him even more, but then, she'd always loved strength in all its forms. Even the teasing kind. "I'm not surrendering , you know." He pursed his lips and shook his head, all oh, no, of course not. And then he started to pull out of her. As she growled low in her throat, she sank her nails into his ass. "Where do you think you're going ?”-Xhex and John</b><br><br><a href="http://s327.photobucket.com/user/jessica_hatfield1/media/JohnandXhex_zpsmoujbcnb.jpg.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">

</a><br><br><b>“When she orgasmed, she said his name. Twice. And didn’t it make him glad that even though he had no voice, his ears worked just fine. –John</b><br><br>John and Xhex together were explosive and sexy as hell. OMG they had some major heat. When they came together it was raw, powerful and totally gave me hot flashes lol. <br><br><b>Might have been smoother to do that butterfly-kisses bullshit. Might have shown more finesse to tease her with his tongue and his fingertips. Fuck that. With a raw, whipping need, he latched onto her core with his mouth, sucking her into him, taking her deep, swallowing her up. His orgasm had left some of him on her and he tasted that along with her honey--and the bonded male in him relished the combination.-John</b><br><br>I loved Blay in this book. I was totally pissed at Qhuinn and sick of him hurting Blay. If Qhuinn ain't man enough to be with Blay he needs to get the fuck outta the way and let Blay be happy else were. I was glad that Blay moved on and started a relationship with Saxton. I hated Lash but since he was the bad guy I guess that is a good thing. I just wish I had less of him. I also couldn't stand the crap about Eliahu Rathboone/Muhrder. I skipped every bit of it. I know J.R. Ward said she plans to bringing Muhrder back and that is fine but he better keep his ass away from my John's Xhex. If he comes back and starts crap for Xhex and John Imma be pissed just sayin'! I loved that Tohr and John made up. It was fun getting to see the back story for Tohr, Darius, No'One, and Xhex. Again it needs to be said that Z was just amazing every time he showed up on the page. The way he put himself out there and told John about his past to help Xhex was so sweet. Z has grown so much since book 1. Lover Mine was such a epic read. I was so invested in Xhex and John's story. They are my second favorite couple right after Z and Bella. Their powerful connection and touching love story made for hours of happy feels. And their Mating was beautiful. I loved this book!!! Payne was great in this book and I know her book is next. I am so looking forward to her story. <br><br><b>“John leaned in and pressed his lips to hers; then he stretched out beside her. His body was exhausted but, his heart was alive with a joy so pure it was like the sunlight he didn't get to see anymore: He was a mute-ass motherfucker with a nasty past and a night job that involved fighting evil and slaughtering the undead. And in spite of all that... he'd gotten the girl.”-John<br><br><br><br>“You don't go after what's mine. Now be a good boy and gut yourself." -Xhex,<br><br><br><br><br>"Then you would hold me up, wouldn't you." He traced over her features with his fingertips. And as he did, for some strange reason, he felt the arms of infinity wrapping around them both, holding them close... linking them forever. Yes, he mouthed. I would hold you up. I will ever hold you up and hold you dear, lover mine.-Xhex and John</b></span></div></div></div></section></section><section class="ReviewCard__tags"><ul class="CollapsableList"><a

class="ReviewText"><section class="ReviewText__content"><div class="TruncatedText"><div class="TruncatedText__text TruncatedText__text--5" data-testid="contentContainer"><div><span class="Formatted">Okay, I'm giving this book four stars, not because of its literary prowess, but because of its enjoyability.<br /><br />However, after eight books in this series, I have a serious problem. Well, frankly I had a problem from the first book but I've already reviewed that one.<br /><br />My big problem is in the characters and the gender roles they embody. Now, there's been a great deal of criticism over J.R. Ward's treatment of female characters in these books. Xhex and Payne are like a bandaid she uses to patch this up. <br /><br />Now, honestly I am one of the few who actually always liked Xhex as a character. It didn't change in this book. John Matthews was always one of my most liked characters. Their show, in this book, was kind of stolen by Blay and Quinn who I found myself desperately hoping would have some kind of resolution for their relationship. <br /><br />As usual, J.R.Ward does what most romantic novelists do. She creates characters whose every problem can be fixed by love and great sex. I'm sorry but I was literally bashing my head on something very hard when Xhex, after being held prisoner for almost four weeks and brutally raped several times, had great sex with John Matthews. No. No. No. <br /><br />I'm not even going to go into that one except to say: No. To all future writers out there: Don't do it. That is just... I have no words for that one.<br /><br />However, the big problem with the characters wasn't that they weren't likable or interesting, or that the woman wasn't "equal" enough. It was the character roles they play. J.R. Ward doesn't seem to get this.<br /><br />In fact, I wonder if she'll ever get this. The complaints about poor female characters in her book don't necessitate the creation of female protagonists who are practically men with vaginas. Creating a female character who walks, talks, acts and thinks like a man doesn't create a positive female protagonist (especially when she spends so much time complaining about how weak women are)! Our issues weren't that your women were weak characters (okay, maybe a little bit) but the roles that define them for goodness sake!<br /><br />In this series the men are men and the women are there to be protected, cherished and ultimately invisible. The only, Only woman who appears repeatedly is Doc Jane and occasionally Ehlena because they need to stitch someone up. Why? As soon as they are married and happy with their partners do they suddenly become non-existent? Oh, sorry, they show up for the inevitable wedding at the end of each book and cry like babies. <br /><br />However, I get that you, J.R. Ward have been actively trying to give them varied professions and passions and hobbies to make up for the fact that Beth dropped her entire life to go play Queen with Wrath and for several books didn't appear to have anything to fucking do. I get that that's why there's now a doctor and a nurse and a counselor and and the director of a female's home etc. Now there is Xhex who will be fighting with the big boys. *Facepalms* I don't even know how to touch on this anymore without breaking out into cussing so inevitably varied and violent that my review will be removed by Goodreads...<br /><br />My biggest problem isn't actually the female gender roles that are fucked up in these books, believe it or not. It's the men's! The portrayal of masculinity in these books makes me want to cry. Studies have shown that whilst an appalling number of women will suffer from violence at the hands of men (25%), men are actually moreso the victims of violence at their own hands! 70% of men will, at one point or another, be the victim of violence against them. These books say that to be a man you have to be muscled to within an inch of your life and you must be violent. THIS DOESN'T HELP THE SITUTATION. Every male protagonist in this book is violent, animalistic, uncontrolled and hyper-masculine to the point of ridiculousness. <br /><br />Now, I'm not saying that I prefer the pansy-ass sparklepires over something that does more than brood in your general direction if you're evil. I'm just saying that there needs to be a more divergent representation of what it is to be male. Because frankly, masculinity is no more tied to the size of your muscles than femininity is to one's beauty. <br /><br />My challenge to J.R. Ward is not to create a female protagonist who embodies positive gender roles but to create a male protagonist that is still masculine and sexy despite the fact that he is not a muscleman who walked out of the caveman era. For goodness sake, in the reader's guide not a SINGLE male could list a book that they'd read that WASN'T a book that they'd read to Nalla. That's right. Every single male in the guide doesn't read except to a baby. <br /><br />And women must be gentle and protected and kept away. That is, unless they're a spitfire dead doctor who can't be harmed anyway or a woman with a mangina that can be seen from space.</span></div></div></div></section></section><section

</blockquote><br><br><br><b>Amazing! <br>This book is very emotional, and tough to go through, but I loved every minute of it! John and Xhex are such a great couple, perfect for each other &lt;3 <br><br><br><br>The story</b><br><br><br>This picks up right after the ending of Lover Avenged.<br>Xhex is missing, and they all suspect Lash is the one responsible for it.<br>After a month of searching, no leads have been found, and it's driving John to the edge. He knows what must have happened to her and he wants to avenge her, without the Brotherhood's knowledge.<br>Xhex is being held by Lash (OMG how I hate his guts with an undying flame!!!!!!), who is obsessed with her and enjoys it every time she fights against him. <br>She is cut off from the world in a weird kind of energy bubble or something, she can't be seen or touched or perceived in any kind of way by anyone except Lash, and she's focusing all her strength on giving as much as she got to Lash, making him hurt.<br>I won't say anything about her getting out, you have to see it for yourself :P<br>Anyway, John and Xhex will have to work together to defeat their enemy, and their dominant natures will clash often, but their love is the most important thing &lt;3 and it will win &lt;3<br><br><br><blockquote>

</blockquote><br><br><br><b>The story</b> - interesting from first to last page! What can I say, I didn't even have the desire to skip or skim antyhing, I wanted to read it all! *except the lesser/Lash part, of course*<br>John and Xhex go through a lot in this one, and I loved that there's more action than in the last ones :)<br><br><b>The characters</b> - This book is mostly focused on John and Xhex, and that's great since their story needed a lot of page time.<br><b>Blay/Qhuinn</b> - Their friendship isn't doing well, mainly because Blay is jealous and hurt by Qhuinn's rejection. They have some ups and downs, and Qhuinn shows his jealous side when Blay finds someone. <br>I have to say, I'm really glad for that, Blay deserves to go on with his life, not just mope around because Qhuinn doesn't want him, and Qhuinn should get a little taste of his own medicine considering he f*cked everything with legs and Blay had to watch it all.<br><b>Saxton</b> - A vampire lawyer and Blay's new love interest. <br>I like the guy :) Even though in my heart I root for Qhuay, I don't really mind Blay being with Saxton. <br>PLUS! My mind is having all sorts of ideas what could happen with Saxton later on, maybe we'll have another M/M book? Or is that just wishful thinking :((((<br><b>Payne</b> - She is forced to remain in the Sanctuary, the Scribe Virgin will not let her go, and it's driving her insane. <br>This is an intro into Lover Unleashed with something major happening at the end of the book :)<br><b>Tohrment</b> - Is slowly getting his strength back, even though he is still mourning Wellsie. He knows he's done wrong by John, and he tries to make it up for him. It was so touching, that scene at the end &lt;3<br><b>No'One</b> - She lives in the Sanctuary with the Chosen ones, and we get a little shocker at the end about her :))) That's an intro into book 10 ;)<br><br><b>The ghost story</b> - Was that really necessary? It had absolutely nothing to do with anything in the book. It's just a page filler. I do not approve :P<br><br><b>The flashbacks</b> - Since this is John Matthew's book, we get flashbacks into Darius and Tohrment's history, and it all clicks into place at the end of the book. Meant to be, I say. For both of them :)<br><br><br><blockquote>

F*ck yeah! I am proud of her like hell! <br>When she screamed :((( OMG that was horrible.

Just . . . leave me alone.”<br>As the door shut behind the guy, Qhuinn cursed under his breath and wondered if he would ever be able to do that.<br>Not anytime soon, a voice said in his head. Maybe not ever.</b>

class="ReviewText"><section class="ReviewText__content"><div class="TruncatedText"><div class="TruncatedText__text TruncatedText__text--5" data-testid="contentContainer"><div><span class="Formatted">I’ve tried for months to write a review that would do this book justice but I have so many thoughts and feelings running through my mind that I can’t seem to form a coherent paragraph, much less an entire review! So after months of trying and failing, this is the best I could do. Please allow me to present to you – <br /><br /><b>My Random Thoughts <i>Rave-view</i> with Spoilers Aplenty</b><br /><br />Last time I checked, the WARDen wasn’t yet claiming to walk on water, so I see no need to critique her writing style, lack of perfection or editing issues, or the occasional minor inconsistencies. Rather, quite simply put; this is about my thoughts on the many storylines and how this book made me feel which I’ll just say right up front was captivated, fascinated, mesmerized and enthralled. I didn’t think it was possible, but I’m more in love with the Black Dagger Brotherhood’s world and the Brothers themselves than I was before. And yes, even those Brothers who aren’t Brothers, yet.<br /><br />At first I was annoyed with the page time devoted to the paranormal investigative crew. I just wanted to read about the Brothers, especially John Matthew, and of course, Xhex. But, and I should have known that this would happen, by the time we reached the end of the book it was clear what their role was and I thought it was a rather ingenious way to bring Murhder back into the story. And now that Xhex knows exactly where he is, I wonder how he’ll be brought into the fold. That is one story I can’t wait to read!<br /><br />Blay and Qhuinn, collectively known as <i>Qhuay</i>, were just as annoying as ever. Well, let me restate that. Qhuinn was just as annoying as ever. There were several times I wanted to slap him right upside his head. I still think that Blay is too good for him, and that Qhuinn has a lot of ass kissing to do before I’ll ever accept him as Blay’s <i>happily ever after</i>. I suppose that eventually we’ll find out why he’s such a bastard to Blay most of the time, so rather than hold a grudge, I’ll wait for his story when, at last, I’ll come to love him. I have a feeling their story is going to be huge based on the buildup we’ve been given.<br /><br />How many times have we heard that men and women just can’t communicate? Well, I love how Xhex doesn’t need John Matthew’s words to know what he’s thinking or feeling. Her sympath ability tells her everything he cannot, and what’s more, she feels it exactly as he does so there’s never any miscommunication going on. For a long time I had never really felt that she was a compelling addition to the BDB cast of characters, but <i>Lover Mine</i> changed all that like I knew it would. She’s strong and independent yet fiercely loyal. She’s compassionate, yet takes no crap from anyone. She’s sexy and beautiful on the inside as well as the out. She is, in short, John Matthew’s other half that makes their perfect whole. Or, as John Matthew sees it; <i>’She was the missing piece to his puzzle, the twelfth in his dozen, the first and last page of his book.’</i><br /><br />Speaking of John Matthew *sigh* I’ll be honest here; I had a hard time thinking of him as a Warrior. He was still the pre-trans JM I grew to love and I was worried I’d never see him as anything more than that, but by the end of <i>Lover Mine</i> I saw him as what he’d truly become: A male of worth. I loved how we got a closer look into the deeper side of him. The aggressive, alpha male who wanted to protect his female, and when he felt that he failed, no one or nothing was safe – not even the treadmill ;)<br /><br />Zsadist, my favorite Brother of them all. Another *sigh* How far he’s come from the days of keeping secrets, hiding his embarrassment of a past he hadn’t chosen and that he’d had no control over. I loved seeing him get real with JM, open up and finally let it be known that they have more in common than JM had ever realized. I hope they get tight.<br /><br />Oh, how I enjoyed Darius’ journal entries and watching as he and Tohr became such close friends. It was great getting a chance to really meet Darius – to see what we’ve been missing. And I loved how he took care of Tohr when no one else would and how things have really come full circle, haven’t they?<br /><br />The Scribe Bitch…errrr….ummm… I mean <i>Virgin</i> (like any of us believe that crock of crap anymore) I’m still not liking her. I think it’s time she retire to wherever it is that old, useless Scribe Virgins retire to and let someone else take over – Oh, let’s say No’One perhaps, who would then be too busy trying to repair the previous Scribe Virgin’s screw ups to get involved with Tohr and ruin his and Wellsie’s <i>happily ever after</i>. <b>Note to the WARDen – </b> feel free to use that story line for No’One. I won’t ask for any credit or royalties, whatever it takes to keep her away from Tohr. Hey, I’m just sayin’…<br /><br />Lash – ha! He was on top of the world there for awhile, wasn’t he? Thinking he was the greatest thing since sliced bread. Whatever. Amazing how quickly and easily the mighty fall… or should I say, <i>fall apart!!</i> **wink, wink**<br /><br />Payne!!! I loved getting to know her better. I think she’s going to be such a fantastic addition to the story. I can just see her now, trying to help her twin, Vishous, cope with finding out he’s got a sister. Won’t it be interesting to see how that plays out? V had just begun rebuilding that relationship with his mother and now… WOW! That’s going to be some major drama I don’t want to miss! I’m thrilled that we’re going to get to see Manny in the next book, too. That’s one man who’s been waiting in the wings too long. I want his story, and soon!<br /><br />And how could I have almost forgotten Layla?!? That poor girl needs to get laid, end of story.<br /><br />Some of my favorite quotes from this book, though there were many, I’ll only list a few.<br /><br />**“No, you’ve got it all wrong, John.” Reading his emotions, she shook her head and eased back. “You’re not half the male you could be because of what was done to you. You’re twice what anyone else is because you survived.” -Xhex<br /><br />**“Motherf**ker. Bastard ass motherf**ker. C**ks**king rat-bitch bastard motherf**ker!” –Blay (I tried using this on my kids to get them to clean their rooms. It didn’t work and the buggers tried to ground me from Goodreads! Hmmmph! Teenagers.)<br /><br />**‘When she orgasmed, she said his name. Twice. And didn’t it make him glad that even though he had no voice, his ears worked just fine.’ -JM<br /><br />**‘You are so beautiful, he mouthed. But of course she couldn’t see his lips. Guess he was going to have to show her.’ -JM<br /><br />**‘There was broad consensus in the room for the plan, as well as some cheap shots involving Lash’s ass and various kinds of large-bore instruments of impact: size-fourteen boots being the most likely to come to pass, but hardly the most creative. For example, John seriously doubted Rhage could in fact park his GTO in the guy’s sun-don’t-shine. Or would want to.’<br /><br />Once again I’m in awe of the WARDen’s writing ability and how she can consistently give us such deeply compelling characters who we truly do care about. The story lines are so varied and so many, it’s amazing to me she can keep them all straight! And not only keep them straight, but have them become interwoven book after book. My only complaint is that she’s not writing fast enough to keep my Black Dagger Brotherhood hunger sated. Oh, that and the fact that Zsadist is still with that Bella chick and hasn’t yet realized that I’ll make a much better <i>shellan</i> than she ever could.<br

</a><br><br><br><b>LOVER MINE</b> is the story of John Mathews aka Tehrror and Xhex aka Xhexania and is book #8th on this series. This series takes place in the city of Caldwell, NY. In a world of Vampires, Sympaths (they can sense emotions and control minds), Lessers (humans that were killed by the evil Omega, he removed their hearts and converted them to soulless evil creatures to work for him) and of course the Humans. The Vampires protect their bloodline and fight against the evil Omega and his lessers' society that he has created and to keep the humans safe as well.<br><a href="http://tinypic.com?ref=auh06u" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">

</a><br><br><br><br><b>John Mathews</b> is a vampire who is mute and unable to speak. My boy has gone through a lot of sadness and trauma in his young life until the brotherhood found him and saved him. He is now one big madafucker warrior that fights with the brotherhood. He was a warrior who at some point in the series fell in love with Xhex and there was just no going back for him. He wanted to protect her but she wouldn't let him in because she didn't know how to have someone cared for her even if he thought the feeling was not mutual.<br><br><p>

</a><br><br><br><b>Xhex</b> is a half Vampire &amp; half Sympath. She is a bad ass female assassin who always watched her own back and depended on no one. She also had a hard, sad, young past so she was a very hard rock to break through. John had a difficult childhood of his own and his inability to speak made this relationship unique because even thought he couldn't communicate by speaking only through sign language she could sense his feelings and emotions and some times read his thoughts. It worked for them.<br><br><p>

</a><br><br><br><b>Xhex and JM</b> were absolutely perfect for each other. Their sad and traumatic past and the chemistry between these too was just too much sometimes. I sobbed for JM, I sobbed for Xhex, for all the pain and the shit they both went through. See the thing was, both were survivors and they never gave up. So in a way I completely understand their struggles they went through to finally be together. <br><br><p>

There was no way to comfort the lost boy he'd been back then. <br>But she had the grown male.<br>She had him right in her arms, and for a brief moment of whimsy, she imagined that she was never, ever going to let him go.” Xhex</i>

</a><br><br><br>When a male of honor finds his soul-mate everyone knows it by the scent and spices that brings out of the male body it's called "BONDED".

</a><br><br><br>The book started right where book 7 left off. That evil Lash (son of the Omega) had stolen Xhex and kept her captive for his own evil doing. The ugly things he did to her had me so angry and upset and ughhh...My emotions were going wild. I freaking hated him since the beginning of the series and this book made me hate him more. John Mathews was a wild mess searching and searching to find her. He felt hopeless at some times and trying to find her I was dying inside with him just freaking anxious. I wanted to hurt Lash so much. Lots of shit happened, lots of fighting and action with the Vampires and Lessers thought this book. <br><a href="http://tinypic.com?ref=312tid2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">

</a><br><br><br>Xhex was able to get herself out of on her own only because Lash was getting weaker because he was going through a transformation of his own into the darkness. However, she wouldn't accept anyone's help and she was about to die and my baby John found her and saved her. Gawd...I loved him so much for it. He was the absolute ultimate male of honor the amazing alpha on this book. He was everything. Possessive over Xhex and protective too. She was stubborn but his true love without expecting anything in return won her over and she finally gave into his love. She too was a bad ass bitch who took possessiveness over him and saved his life couple of times as well. Their sex was freaking amazing. OMG...SUPER HOT...<br><br><p>

</a><br><br><br>I am trying not to chock while writing this review because it was so emotional. My anxiety levels were up in the sky. The sexual tension was so much to bare between Qhuinn and Blay it hurt so much it was painful. Even thought I am not into M/M you can't help liking these two because you fell in love with both characters from book one and I know I'm up for a hell of a heartbreak until I can get to their book which is #11 ;( . We saw a little of Payne on this book too and I can't wait to read hers next. The little bits of pieces we got on this book just gutted me. Omg seriously her twin brother, my man V and her?!...they just had no clue about each other. <br><a href="http://tinypic.com?ref=qx09ax" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">

</a><br><br>The author always seems to have side stories thought and sometimes it kind of slows the books a little but these couple of side stories I really enjoyed because OMG they made so much sense at the end like seriously I was in shocked and amazed on how beautifully it all clicked at the end. The first side story was about Darius and Tohr, it was just beautiful. I sobbed for that mother and that baby it was just too much but then everything made so much sense at the end it felt so good. I felt so much relief and happiness. The second side story was about a couple who where filming a live hunted house, it was about a ghost story. I had no idea why on the hell that story was relevant until the end I was like omfg holy shit...The ending was EPIC, I mean absolutely beautiful I was so happy for JM &amp; Xhex they finally get their happy ending. The tension &amp; anxiety of what is to come for the entire Brotherhood is so intense and I just cannot wait to see what more is in store on the next books.<br><a href="http://tinypic.com?ref=2gy1yc8" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">

</a><br><br>Overall, I think this book was by far my favorite one since I started the series. I freaking loved everything about it and I cannot wait to read more about my favorite brothers. <br><br><p>

  <u>Forth "re-read": 31.07.2021</u>
</b><br>Holy shit these books are long. That said, I ONLY re-read Qhuinn and Blay's parts; meaning I skipped everything else again. And that one scene... it just gets me so fucking emotional.<br><br><blockquote>
  <b>
    <i>With stumbling feet, he blindly walked somewhere, anywhere. When he got to the king’s study, he looked over his shoulder and checked the carpet over which he’d trodden.<br>No trail of his blood. Which, considering the way his chest was hurting, was a surprise.<br>Sure as shit felt like he’d been shot in the heart.</i>

  <u>Third re-read: 23.08.2019</u>
</b><br>I cried again. When Qhuinn told Blay to take care of himself. It's so heartbreaking. I love everything about Qhuinn and Blay's storyline, except for the Layla part. I don't like that. Again, <b>I <b><i><u>only</u></i></b> re-read Qhuinn and Blay's parts</b>. Hell, if I were only rating <i>their</i> part in these books, the ratings would be at at least 4 stars.<br><img src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1445268775i/16623124.jpg" class="gr-hostedUserImg" loading="lazy"><br><b>
  <u>Second re-read: 11.07.2017</u>
</b><br>As you all know; I <i>love</i> Qhuinn. Which is why I <u>
  <b>only</b>
</u> re-read his and Blay's POVs. Which I did the last time as well. I just can't get enough of them two. I mean, <b>J.R. Ward</b> writes that <i>pain</i> they both feel, specially Qhuinn, so damn brilliantly, that I always feel that damn pain in my chest. I just want my babies happy. <br><blockquote>
  <b>
    <i>“Blay.”<br>“Yeah?”<br>“You take care of yourself.”<br>Now Blay’s voice was hoarse to the point of cracking. “Yeah. You, too.”<br>Because of course, “take care of you” was what Qhuinn always said when he was letting someone go.”</i>

  <u>Re-read: 13.01.2017</u>
</b><br>Though I cannot really consider this a re-read considering I <b>only</b> re-read <b>Blay</b> and <b>Qhuinn</b> POVs. I love those two. It's strange, because normally I don't read male on male romance, but these two guys? They suck you in. That scene at the end? Breaks my heart every time.<br><blockquote>
  <b>
    <i>I miss you. I miss you so fucking bad it hurts, but I don't know how to find you even though you're right in front of me.</i>

In Lover Mine, We'll see the long distance for John to save his first and only love. John Matthew, as you know that he reborn with Darius' soul, he has no memory of what happened before this life, so he lives his life as a new one and falls in love again. That's a complex and interesting story of this book.<br><br><b>
  <blockquote>“The truth was...he was in love with her. Totally over-the-line, no-going-back, not-even-dead-would-he-part kind of shit.”</blockquote>

John's feelings towards Xhex are so deep and touching. There's nothing he can't do to bring his female back. The development of this character is visibly good, I've have known John since Rhage's book and I'm not disapointed by his story at all. And I decided to condone Qhuinn and Blay's stupid behavior because I knew that J.R. Ward had to build the conflict to prepare them for Lover At Last, however, it's fun to see these guys chase their tails all the time.<br><br><b>

class="Formatted">Opening Line: <i>"He wished he had more time."</i><br /><br />**Spoiler Free**<br />In trying to review LOVER MINE two words keep popping into my head; Amazing and Damn… just damn. How can I honestly put into words how much I loved this story and how sad I am that it’s over? Following a year long wait JR Wards 8th instalment of the Black Dagger Brotherhood finally made its way into my eager little hands. At 512 pages LOVER MINE is huge (with a fantastic cover) and I’m happy to report that it does not disappoint, in fact with John Mathews long awaited story the WARDen positively shines. <br /><br />Fans are given exactly what we’ve been waiting for with ever evolving storylines, multiple POV’s, surprises, tragedies, plot twists, ass-kicking action,(Xhex much) humour and oh the romance. Completed here with erotic, blush-worthy love scenes and of course the inevitable struggle and heartache. I can tell you that this story brought me to tears more than once and not for the reasons you might expect. All of this awesomeness has been wrapped up with Wards unique style of writing, complete with product placements, rap music, unique street language, multiple f-bombs and a whole new batch of cool Wardisms I can’t wait to start using, you feel me.<br /><br />The series is brought full circle within this book with loose ends cleverly tied together and resolutions brought to story threads we’ve had growing and brewing since the beginning. Sadly I realized that even with Ward continuing indefinitely JM/Darius will be the last of the original brothers to have his story told and that with this book being red, just like book 1 (<a href="https://goodreads.com/book/show/42899.Dark_Lover__Black_Dagger_Brotherhood___1_" title="Dark Lover (Black Dagger Brotherhood, #1) by J.R. Ward" rel="noopener">Dark Lover</a>) she’s given us book ends of a sort.<br /><br />With us since the beginning, in this instalment we finally get John Mathew (and Darius‘s) story. Of all the characters John is the one we have the greatest sense of and have invested the most time in, having watched him change from a scrawny, neglected and abused pre-trans into an enormous, and angry male with a ton of fricken baggage. His pairing with the half Sympath Xhex has been in the works for some time now and with her abduction in the end of (<a href="https://goodreads.com/book/show/5098079.Lover_Avenged__Black_Dagger_Brotherhood___7_" title="Lover Avenged (Black Dagger Brotherhood, #7) by J.R. Ward" rel="noopener">Lover Avenged</a>) we have the perfect place to begin their story. (Which I’m not going to give away) I will say however that I was pleased to see reflections of the sweet, sensitive John we remember (only now oozing sex appeal) and witness a softer side of Xhex. As always their path to HEA is not an easy one but its fun and sexy as hell watching them open up to each other and get there.<br /><br />As a whole the storyline blew my mind. With three very separate and distinct running plotlines, (which at first had me wondering, where the hell is this going?) Ward manages to merge all the puzzle pieces together into WOW, bringing us deliciously full circle. Darker and more serious than past books my only real complaint would be the lack of banter between the Brothers and the Brothers as a whole. The moments that we’re given are excellent and while they’re all represented to a degree (some more than others) I insatiably craved more and truly missed them. Qhuinn and Blay, each now with their own POV manage to somewhat fill the gap who along with Saxton bring a different degree of heartache, sexiness and hot mess to the mix. Lash is also back as the Lessening societies leader and surprisingly awesome here as he takes things to a whole new gooey level of evil. <br /><br />In the end Ward leaves us smiling with contentment, with new characters emerging and events opening up for future stories that I can’t wait to discover. I just wish it wasn’t so far away because I find that after getting just 3 days with the BDB its already time to leave them again and I’m not quite ready to let them go yet. See ya next year boys, stay safe Cheers!<br /><br />Oh, and in case you were wondering Ward dedicates this book to John Mathew himself(which was what started my first crying jag)<br /></span></div></div></div></section></section><section class="ReviewCard__tags"><ul class="CollapsableList"><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/3099666?shelf=good-bad-guy" class="Button

things are destined to be-\u003cbr /\u003eIt just takes us a couple of tries\u003cbr /\u003eto get there.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eLover Mine is the eighth book in the Black Dagger Brotherhood series. It’s about second chances. About circumstances and relationships coming full circle. About revenge, trust, friendship and love. But most importantly: it’s about John Matthew. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eJohn Matthew, aka Darius reincarnated, is undoubtedly one of the most popular characters in the series. When we meet him in Lover Eternal, he’s a scrawny little mute who lives in a run down apartment and carries a big secret with him. In Lover Mine he has turned into a beautiful vampire male with a warrior body, who lives with the King of his race and fights with the Black Dagger Brotherhood. \u003cbr /\u003eWarrior body or not, inside John Matthew feels small, empty and out of place. He wants to belong to someone and his object of affection is Xhex.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eNow Xhex must be one of the most controversial characters of the series. With her athletic body, her strong features, her men’s haircut and her tough as nails attitude, she’s hardly your typical romance heroine. But there’s much more than meets the eye to Xhex and John is drawn to her like a moth to a flame.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eTo me, the great thing about John and Xhex’s relationship is that it has been running for a couple of books. We experienced their initial awkwardness, followed by sexual tension, tentative trust and full on implosion. Lover Mine finally gives them their HEA. But to accomplish this they need to overcome the burdens of the past and learn to truly trust each other. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eUnlike previous books, the love story had a prominent role in this one. In previous editions, the secondary plots set up a back story for the next books. This book introduced a few new characters but pretty much left it at that. \u003cbr /\u003eThe focus was on love and closure. John and Xhex got a truly wonderful love story which turned out to be of epic proportions due to Darius’ involvement. Their scenes were emotional, exciting, heartbreaking and scorching hot and these two characters ended up being much more alike than anyone would have thought. \u003cbr /\u003eThe secondary plot which also focused on love was about the relationship between Qhuinn and Blay. Oh… the tension! The mixed and missed signals! The angst! It was really hard to bear and many times left me on the edge of my seat or screaming “noohoooo” to the book. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAnother great thing about Lover Mine was the villain: Lash. Lash truly is the best thing that ever happened to the lessers. He single-handedly changed the lesser scenes from boring and skip-worthy to exciting, not to miss, sometimes hilarious. He is bad with a vengeance but he’s engaging and interesting and funny. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAfter all this raving and the 5 star rating you would think I found this book to be absolutely perfect, but sadly: no. There were many things, small and big which irked me. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eFirst of all: the fashion in which Murhder’s character was introduced left a lot to be desired. The whole story about the camera crew seemed redundant and Murhder didn’t leave a good enough impression to be even considered interesting. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAnother story line was a flashback about Darius. Since this book is about closure and looking to the future, I (and everyone with me) had expected a final moment in where the JM/Darius connection would come out in the open… or to an end…. or would transition or…. anything! But no. The way this situation was resolved -or not resolved- was really anticlimactic. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThere were lots of loose threads throughout the book. Things being said or mentioned, never to be picked up later on. Too many things happened in the last 20 pages which made the ending seemed hastily wrapped up and unfinished. \u003cbr /\u003eThere were also quite some inconsistencies. The timeline didn’t make much sense, characters disappeared for short parts of the scenes and popped up in the end, characters who had a relation before did not talk at all (Ehlena and Xhex), etc. \u003cbr /\u003eCertain situations defied all logic: like Xhex not having seen John’s tattoo till pretty much the end of the book, despite all their wild love making. Or Xhex being able to follow a rant in ASL after she’d just learned to spell the alphabet… and then have JM sign slowly to her the next day. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eSo there was some seriously sloppy writing going on (please Ms Ward, find yourself a new editor!) and for a book that is about closure, too many questions were left unanswered. And that makes me sad because there’s no guarantee that they will be answered in the next book and not be forgotten.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAnother thing which makes me sad is that this book seems to mark the end of an era. \u003cbr /\u003eMuch has changed throughout the books but John Matthew’s narrating was a constant factor which saw us readers through the series. It was wonderful to see the world through his eyes but now that he got his own book, I’m very much afraid that we will lose him.\u003cbr /\u003eI'm still holding out hope though... because of this dedication from Ward to John Matthew in the beginning of the book: \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eI cannot believe you and I have come so far\u003cbr /\u003eYour book is not a goodbye, however-\u003cbr /\u003ejust another beginning\u003cbr /\u003eBut you’re used to that…\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eOverall: a good book, 4,5 out 5. But John Matthew deserved a full 5.

I've been waiting so long to see John Matthew and Xhex find their happy ending. Anyone who knows me, knows how much I adore this couple. If it's even possible, I probably love them twenty times more now. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe WARDen is so good at writing stories about human nature, all the weaknesses, the vulnerabilities, the strengths. How, at the end of the day, all of us just want to feel special, to feel loved. And when we don't feel that, how it has the power to destroy us.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eJohn Matthew had the worst start in life possible. He was born in a bathroom stall in a bus station. He was born without the ability to talk. He was horribly assaulted at a young age. He had no one to love him. And just when life started turning around, he lost two people he loved very much. And then he met Xhex. From the beginning, she was the one for him. No one can explain what causes us to fall in love with someone. You can call it hormones, fate, destiny, attraction, random coincidence. There is no concrete way to rationalize it. I for one, felt that pull between them. I knew it was going to be big and life-changing for them both. JM fell apart, big time in Lover Avenged. It was very painful to read, and his actions made me so angry. But, I realized that he had been driven to his breaking point, and he was acting out of complete despair. So, it was really good to see him pull himself together so he could save Xhex. And boy, did he! Oh, could John be a more worthy male? I don't think so. He's so sweet, but so strong. He has a protective instinct, but at the same time, he embraced Xhex's strength, and didn't try to change what made her the woman he loved. He came from nothing, but is full of so much. The WARDen made me fall in love with JM all over again.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eI was so glad that the WARDen took a big, huge chance with crafting a heroine like Xhex. There are a lot of Xhex haters out there in the Black Dagger Brotherhood fandom. They have said some really ugly things about her. It bothers me, because Xhex is such a great character in my opinion. She has so much going on inside of her. She is so strong, yet she has the things that define a woman in my opinion. Some people think she's too manly or not feminine enough. If she can be who she is and have a man like JM totally in love with her, I say sign me up for her version of manly. I say that in a half-serious manner. But with all seriousness, if Xhex had not been the strong woman, the fierce warrior that she is, she would not have survived what she's been through in her life. She lived in a dark, bleak world, with little to support her. She had to be a strong person, to build a fortress around her inner self, or she would have been decimated. And had she been any less fortified, Lash would have destroyed her. It's pretty clear that I adore Xhex. I think she's sexy, beautiful, loving, intense, intelligent, empathetic, formidable, intriguing, the list goes on. She is now my favorite heroine ever. I felt she was the perfect complement to John. It gratified me that Tohr could see it, from the beginning. I didn't need the backstory of Xhex to love her, but I love her even more now. I didn't need to see her as vulnerable and broken as she was in this book to respect and love her. But, seeing her that way, well it just made the happy ending that much better. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eI couldn't have written the ending better. It's like JR Ward took my wish list for Xhex and JM's story and wrote this book based on it. Oh, there were some really hard moments, but I kept the faith that things would work out for them, and boy was I rewarded. I finished this book yesterday morning, and I had to go and reread some of my favorite scenes. The interaction between John and Xhex was so powerful, it turned my heart to mush. The steamy moments really made up for the hurtful interactions they had in Lover Avenged. How unfulfilling their intimate moments were in that book. Their love scenes set my book on fire and singed my hands. Boy, this couple has some chemistry. But, even better, their love for each other had the power to heal them both. Verily, this book makes me believe in true love, and that there is someone for everyone. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eEven though I'd love this book enough to light up a solar system just based on the JM/Xhex story, the other aspects also made it a wonderful read for me. The Qhuinn/Blay story line has progressed in a very good fashion. I was so happy to get more of Blay's viewpoint. Blay is dear to my heart. I love that male. It tore me up to see how much his love for Qhuinn was hurting him. Qhuinn had his heart, but he didn't know what to do with it, so he kept throwing it back. And Blay seemed to have no way to get away from his feelings for Blay. So I was glad to see Saxton come into his life. Saxton is one fine male. I liked him from the beginning. He is just what Blay needs. I'm not sure how long they'll be together, but it's good for now. Qhuinn showed some aspects of his character that I needed to see. I have to admit that I did feel for him, and his low self-worth because of being rejected by his family, but I didn't like his lifestyle. I didn't like how he was acting like he was blind to Blay's love for him, and how it hurt Blay for him to sleep with everyone \u003cb\u003ebut\u003c/b\u003e Blay. I realize that Qhuinn thinks he's not good enough for Blay, but he seemed oblivious to the way he was hurting Blay. I was surprised at how much it hurt to see Qhuinn hurt because Blay had moved on with Saxton. I thought I'd be gratified because he'd know how Blay felt all the time. But, it was so sad for me to read about, because Qhuinn had the opportunity to have Blay, but he was afraid to take the step. And how that must break Qhuinn's heart. I have hopes that things will work out for them, but right now, it's a painful journey. I do think that Qhuinn is going to take a step in a better direction in the forthcoming books. And Blay will get some love and affection like he needs, although his heart will always belong to Qhuinn. I definitely feel for the Qhuinn/Blay fans right now.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eI loved the parts in the past showing Darius and Tohr's relationship. It really explained why Tohr took on JM as a son, because Darius had done the same for him. Darius and Tohr are such fine males. You can see how they helped shape and form the foundation for the Brotherhood that we see today. Tohr always came off as an admirable, honorable man that I cared for, but I have grown to love him even more. My heart is broken for his loss. I can completely understand how it nearly destroyed him. I was so glad to see him on the mend, and to see him and John Matthew come to terms. That close bond that was ripped apart by Wellsie's death has evolved into something very wonderful, as JM comes to see exactly how Tohr felt, and Tohr is able to understand why Xhex is so important to JM. And it feels to good to know that Torh approves of Xhex for JM.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThere were some really great Doc Jane moments. Her expertise as a doctor, but her understanding of people and how to help them deal with illness was a very important part of this book, as she interacted with Xhex in the aftermath of her captivity with Lash, and also with Xhex's fear of hospitals. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eI won't even pretend like this BDB fan girl didn't have some joy-joy moments seeing the other characters. Wow, it was pretty interesting seeing how the backstory with Butch and Xhex, and Vishous' animosity towards Xhex was dealt with. And of course, my smooth criminal, Rehvenge, was in this book enough to encourage me to reread his story again. What a man! I love his relationship with Xhex. And the Shadow brothers, Trez and iAm, have some good moments in this story, as well. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003ePayne's role expands in this book, and I could see the WARDen setting the stage for her book. Part of me sort of feared that this book would be the penultimate culmination of my love for this series, and it would go downhill, but I have a feeling that WARDen is just getting started. Payne is one heck of an interesting character. And her story is sure to enthrall me, based on how things unfold in this book.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAnd, can I say that Murhder has this fan reaching for the cold drinks? I can tell he's going to rock my world. I hope to see a lot more of this male!\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eI cannot do this review without talking about Lash. There are some pretty good words to describe him, but I don't want to be a potty-mouth. He is a perfect contrast to JM in almost every way. He was born with everything and threw it away. His heart is completely rotten, whereas JM couldn't have more goodness in his heart. The fact that he takes and harms the person that JM loves most in the world seemed almost fated, as they come face to face in a conflict that started when they were both soldier trainees. I have to say that he turned out to be a very good villain. I wasn't sure what to think about how the storyline with Lash ended. It needed to go the way it did. But I can't help feeling that there is more to be told on that front. But then, that's one of the things that I love about this series. The way the WARDen plants seeds in my consciousness, and I have questions that make me want to delve deeper into these books. More things for this BDB addict to ponder. Sadly, these characters and this world is frighteningly real to me. Is there a twelve step program for Black Dagger Brotherhood addiction? But then, even if there is a cure, I'm not sure I want it!\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThis book, oh, this book. I can't say how much I loved this latest installment in the Black Dagger Brotherhood series. You know someone needs help when they start tearing up as they write a review. I am freaking hopeless when it comes to this series and this book. It made my dreams come true, but it also took me to some dark places. It makes me ponder fate, and how the ties between others are so convoluted, yet tightly wound, bringing us together and challenging us in ways we don't ever get to understand. This review will be too long if I keep saying everything I want to say. There is just too much to put into words. But I will say four words to Ms. Ward: Thank you so much!!!!

You're twice what anyone else is because you survived.\"-Xhex\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJohn was damn sexy and utterly wonderful. The way he was with Xhex so caring, and supportive. Always putting her first. Very protective, but he never tried to change Xhex. He knew he was in love with a fighter and he didn't disrespect her by acting like she couldn't take care of herself. One of the things I loved the most about John Matthew was even though he was totally kick ass, he had this vulnerable side. His being mute and having been raped when he was a pretran in no way made him weaker they made him stronger, a survivor. John is my second favorite hero of the series. Xhex was also completely amazing. A total bad ass in her own right, she kicked ass and didn't bother with names. So it was heartbreaking and emotional to see her hurt, violated, and helpless. What I love is that she never gave up. A fighter til the end she fought with everything she had. I also loved how soft she was with John Matthew and John Matthew only. She let him in, let her guard down with him. It was cute how he brought out her girly side to a point. She was still kick ass Xhex, but still the softness was very endearing. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003e\" Oh, John...\" And then he stopped dead, lifted his lips from her nipple, and smiled so wide it was a wonder he didn't bust off his front teeth. His expression was one of total and complete gotcha. \" You are a bastard, \" she said on a laugh. He nodded. And pressed into her with his full length again. It was perfect that he was giving her shit and showing her a little of who was boss. Just perfect. Somehow it made her respect him even more, but then, she'd always loved strength in all its forms. Even the teasing kind. \"I'm not surrendering , you know.\" He pursed his lips and shook his head, all oh, no, of course not. And then he started to pull out of her. As she growled low in her throat, she sank her nails into his ass. \"Where do you think you're going ?”-Xhex and John\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://s327.photobucket.com/user/jessica_hatfield1/media/JohnandXhex_zpsmoujbcnb.jpg.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003e\n  \u003cimg src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1491433618i/22410009._SX540_.jpg\" alt=\" photo JohnandXhex_zpsmoujbcnb.jpg\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\"\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003e“When she orgasmed, she said his name.

With a raw, whipping need, he latched onto her core with his mouth, sucking her into him, taking her deep, swallowing her up.

I was totally pissed at Qhuinn and sick of him hurting Blay. If Qhuinn ain't man enough to be with Blay he needs to get the fuck outta the way and let Blay be happy else were. I was glad that Blay moved on and started a relationship with Saxton. I hated Lash but since he was the bad guy I guess that is a good thing. I just wish I had less of him. I also couldn't stand the crap about Eliahu Rathboone/Muhrder. I skipped every bit of it. I know J.R. Ward said she plans to bringing Muhrder back and that is fine but he better keep his ass away from my John's Xhex. If he comes back and starts crap for Xhex and John Imma be pissed just sayin'! I loved that Tohr and John made up. It was fun getting to see the back story for Tohr, Darius, No'One, and Xhex. Again it needs to be said that Z was just amazing every time he showed up on the page. The way he put himself out there and told John about his past to help Xhex was so sweet. Z has grown so much since book 1. Lover Mine was such a epic read. I was so invested in Xhex and John's story. They are my second favorite couple right after Z and Bella. Their powerful connection and touching love story made for hours of happy feels. And their Mating was beautiful. I loved this book!!!

Well, frankly I had a problem from the first book but I've already reviewed that one.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eMy big problem is in the characters and the gender roles they embody. Now, there's been a great deal of criticism over J.R. Ward's treatment of female characters in these books. Xhex and Payne are like a bandaid she uses to patch this up. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eNow, honestly I am one of the few who actually always liked Xhex as a character. It didn't change in this book. John Matthews was always one of my most liked characters. Their show, in this book, was kind of stolen by Blay and Quinn who I found myself desperately hoping would have some kind of resolution for their relationship. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAs usual, J.R.Ward does what most romantic novelists do. She creates characters whose every problem can be fixed by love and great sex. I'm sorry but I was literally bashing my head on something very hard when Xhex, after being held prisoner for almost four weeks and brutally raped several times, had great sex with John Matthews. No. No. No. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eI'm not even going to go into that one except to say: No. To all future writers out there: Don't do it. That is just... I have no words for that one.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eHowever, the big problem with the characters wasn't that they weren't likable or interesting, or that the woman wasn't \"equal\" enough. It was the character roles they play. J.R. Ward doesn't seem to get this.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eIn fact, I wonder if she'll ever get this. The complaints about poor female characters in her book don't necessitate the creation of female protagonists who are practically men with vaginas. Creating a female character who walks, talks, acts and thinks like a man doesn't create a positive female protagonist (especially when she spends so much time complaining about how weak women are)! Our issues weren't that your women were weak characters (okay, maybe a little bit) but the roles that define them for goodness sake!\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eIn this series the men are men and the women are there to be protected, cherished and ultimately invisible. The only, Only woman who appears repeatedly is Doc Jane and occasionally Ehlena because they need to stitch someone up. Why? As soon as they are married and happy with their partners do they suddenly become non-existent? Oh, sorry, they show up for the inevitable wedding at the end of each book and cry like babies. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eHowever, I get that you, J.R. Ward have been actively trying to give them varied professions and passions and hobbies to make up for the fact that Beth dropped her entire life to go play Queen with Wrath and for several books didn't appear to have anything to fucking do. I get that that's why there's now a doctor and a nurse and a counselor and and the director of a female's home etc. Now there is Xhex who will be fighting with the big boys. *Facepalms* I don't even know how to touch on this anymore without breaking out into cussing so inevitably varied and violent that my review will be removed by Goodreads...\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eMy biggest problem isn't actually the female gender roles that are fucked up in these books, believe it or not. It's the men's! The portrayal of masculinity in these books makes me want to cry. Studies have shown that whilst an appalling number of women will suffer from violence at the hands of men (25%), men are actually moreso the victims of violence at their own hands! 70% of men will, at one point or another, be the victim of violence against them. These books say that to be a man you have to be muscled to within an inch of your life and you must be violent. THIS DOESN'T HELP THE SITUTATION. Every male protagonist in this book is violent, animalistic, uncontrolled and hyper-masculine to the point of ridiculousness. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eNow, I'm not saying that I prefer the pansy-ass sparklepires over something that does more than brood in your general direction if you're evil. I'm just saying that there needs to be a more divergent representation of what it is to be male. Because frankly, masculinity is no more tied to the size of your muscles than femininity is to one's beauty. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eMy challenge to J.R. Ward is not to create a female protagonist who embodies positive gender roles but to create a male protagonist that is still masculine and sexy despite the fact that he is not a muscleman who walked out of the caveman era. For goodness sake, in the reader's guide not a SINGLE male could list a book that they'd read that WASN'T a book that they'd read to Nalla. That's right. Every single male in the guide doesn't read except to a baby. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAnd women must be gentle and protected and kept away. That is, unless they're a spitfire dead doctor who can't be harmed anyway or a woman with a mangina that can be seen from space.","rating":3,"shelving":{"__typename":"Shelving","shelf":{"__typename":"Shelf","name":"read","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/3270188?shelf=read"},"taggings":[{"__typename":"Tagging","tag":{"__typename":"Tag","name":"romance-romance-romance","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/3270188?shelf=romance-romance-romance"}}],"webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/100498877"},"likeCount":109,"viewerHasLiked":null,"commentCount":14,"viewerCanComment({\"resourceType\":\"review\"})":null},"User:8310179":{"id":8310179,"__typename":"User","legacyId":8310179,"imageUrlSquare":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/users/1420469509i/8310179._UX200_CR0,7,200,200_.jpg","isAuthor":false,"textReviewsCount":463,"viewableName":"Blacky *Romance Addict*","isBlockedByViewer":false,"webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8310179-blacky-romance-addict","contributor":null,"isFollowing":false,"isFriend":false,"followersCount":6066},"Review:kca://review:goodreads/amzn1.gr.review:goodreads.v1.OSpjoebQlMrUAm8be2Wzww":{"id":"kca://review:goodreads/amzn1.gr.review:goodreads.v1.OSpjoebQlMrUAm8be2Wzww","__typename":"Review","book":{"__ref":"Book:kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.25EnDK6QKSDLg5XtklLfBQ"},"creator":{"__ref":"User:8310179"},"recommendFor":null,"updatedAt":1614233505615,"createdAt":1338751155000,"spoilerStatus":false,"lastRevisionAt":1427246979000,"text":"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1380379704i/736030.jpg\" alt=\"Image Hosted by ImageShack.us\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\n  \u003ci\u003e\n    \u003cb\u003e\"As she stood beside John Matthew, and watched his huge body crumple down by the bed, the organ that beat behind her sternum shattered like a mirror.\u003cbr\u003eNothing but shards.\u003cbr\u003eShe was utterly and completely ruined as he cradled that pillow like it was a newborn, and in this moment of his utter despair, she would have done anything to ease his pain: Even though she had no idea why he felt the way he so clearly did, the reasons were unimportant.\u003cbr\u003eHis suffering was paramount.\"\u003c/b\u003e\n  \u003c/i\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eAmazing! \u003cbr\u003eThis book is very emotional, and tough to go through, but I loved every minute of it!

Please allow me to present to you – \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003eMy Random Thoughts \u003ci\u003eRave-view\u003c/i\u003e with Spoilers Aplenty\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eLast time I checked, the WARDen wasn’t yet claiming to walk on water, so I see no need to critique her writing style, lack of perfection or editing issues, or the occasional minor inconsistencies. Rather, quite simply put; this is about my thoughts on the many storylines and how this book made me feel which I’ll just say right up front was captivated, fascinated, mesmerized and enthralled. I didn’t think it was possible, but I’m more in love with the Black Dagger Brotherhood’s world and the Brothers themselves than I was before. And yes, even those Brothers who aren’t Brothers, yet.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAt first I was annoyed with the page time devoted to the paranormal investigative crew. I just wanted to read about the Brothers, especially John Matthew, and of course, Xhex. But, and I should have known that this would happen, by the time we reached the end of the book it was clear what their role was and I thought it was a rather ingenious way to bring Murhder back into the story. And now that Xhex knows exactly where he is, I wonder how he’ll be brought into the fold. That is one story I can’t wait to read!\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eBlay and Qhuinn, collectively known as \u003ci\u003eQhuay\u003c/i\u003e, were just as annoying as ever. Well, let me restate that. Qhuinn was just as annoying as ever. There were several times I wanted to slap him right upside his head. I still think that Blay is too good for him, and that Qhuinn has a lot of ass kissing to do before I’ll ever accept him as Blay’s \u003ci\u003ehappily ever after\u003c/i\u003e. I suppose that eventually we’ll find out why he’s such a bastard to Blay most of the time, so rather than hold a grudge, I’ll wait for his story when, at last, I’ll come to love him. I have a feeling their story is going to be huge based on the buildup we’ve been given.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eHow many times have we heard that men and women just can’t communicate? Well, I love how Xhex doesn’t need John Matthew’s words to know what he’s thinking or feeling. Her sympath ability tells her everything he cannot, and what’s more, she feels it exactly as he does so there’s never any miscommunication going on. For a long time I had never really felt that she was a compelling addition to the BDB cast of characters, but \u003ci\u003eLover Mine\u003c/i\u003e changed all that like I knew it would. She’s strong and independent yet fiercely loyal. She’s compassionate, yet takes no crap from anyone. She’s sexy and beautiful on the inside as well as the out. She is, in short, John Matthew’s other half that makes their perfect whole. Or, as John Matthew sees it; \u003ci\u003e’She was the missing piece to his puzzle, the twelfth in his dozen, the first and last page of his book.’\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eSpeaking of John Matthew *sigh* I’ll be honest here; I had a hard time thinking of him as a Warrior. He was still the pre-trans JM I grew to love and I was worried I’d never see him as anything more than that, but by the end of \u003ci\u003eLover Mine\u003c/i\u003e I saw him as what he’d truly become: A male of worth. I loved how we got a closer look into the deeper side of him. The aggressive, alpha male who wanted to protect his female, and when he felt that he failed, no one or nothing was safe – not even the treadmill ;)\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eZsadist, my favorite Brother of them all. Another *sigh* How far he’s come from the days of keeping secrets, hiding his embarrassment of a past he hadn’t chosen and that he’d had no control over. I loved seeing him get real with JM, open up and finally let it be known that they have more in common than JM had ever realized. I hope they get tight.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eOh, how I enjoyed Darius’ journal entries and watching as he and Tohr became such close friends. It was great getting a chance to really meet Darius – to see what we’ve been missing. And I loved how he took care of Tohr when no one else would and how things have really come full circle, haven’t they?\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe Scribe Bitch…errrr….ummm… I mean \u003ci\u003eVirgin\u003c/i\u003e (like any of us believe that crock of crap anymore) I’m still not liking her. I think it’s time she retire to wherever it is that old, useless Scribe Virgins retire to and let someone else take over – Oh, let’s say No’One perhaps, who would then be too busy trying to repair the previous Scribe Virgin’s screw ups to get involved with Tohr and ruin his and Wellsie’s \u003ci\u003ehappily ever after\u003c/i\u003e. \u003cb\u003eNote to the WARDen – \u003c/b\u003e feel free to use that story line for No’One.

Completed here with erotic, blush-worthy love scenes and of course the inevitable struggle and heartache. I can tell you that this story brought me to tears more than once and not for the reasons you might expect.

Ward\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003eLover Avenged\u003c/a\u003e) we have the perfect place to begin their story. (Which I’m not going to give away) I will say however that I was pleased to see reflections of the sweet, sensitive John we remember (only now oozing sex appeal) and witness a softer side of Xhex. As always their path to HEA is not an easy one but its fun and sexy as hell watching them open up to each other and get there.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAs a whole the storyline blew my mind. With three very separate and distinct running plotlines, (which at first had me wondering, where the hell is this going?) Ward manages to merge all the puzzle pieces together into WOW, bringing us deliciously full circle. Darker and more serious than past books my only real complaint would be the lack of banter between the Brothers and the Brothers as a whole. The moments that we’re given are excellent and while they’re all represented to a degree (some more than others) I insatiably craved more and truly missed them. Qhuinn and Blay, each now with their own POV manage to somewhat fill the gap who along with Saxton bring a different degree of heartache, sexiness and hot mess to the mix. Lash is also back as the Lessening societies leader and surprisingly awesome here as he takes things to a whole new gooey level of evil. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eIn the end Ward leaves us smiling with contentment, with new characters emerging and events opening up for future stories that I can’t wait to discover. I just wish it wasn’t so far away because I find that after getting just 3 days with the BDB its already time to leave them again and I’m not quite ready to let them go yet. See ya next year boys, stay safe Cheers!\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eOh, and in case you were wondering Ward dedicates this book to John Mathew himself(which was what started my first crying jag)\u003cbr
