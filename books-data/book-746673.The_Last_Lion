Churchill became Prime Minister—when his tiny island nation stood alone against the overwhelming might of Nazi Germany. The Churchill conjured up by William Manchester and Paul Reid is a man of indomitable courage, lightning fast intellect, and an irresistible will to action. <p><i>The Last Lion</i> brilliantly recounts how Churchill organized his nation's military response and defense; compelled FDR into supporting America's beleaguered cousins, and personified the "never surrender" ethos that helped the Allies win the war, while at the same time adapting himself and his country to the inevitable shift of world power from the British Empire to the United States.</p><p>More than twenty years in the making, <i>The Last Lion</i> presents a revelatory and unparalleled portrait of this brilliant, flawed, and dynamic leader. This is popular history at its most stirring.</p></span></div></div></div></div><div data-testid="genresList" class="BookPageMetadataSection__genres"><ul class="CollapsableList" aria-label="Top genres

can be an exceptional experience. <a href="https://goodreads.com/book/show/746673.The_Last_Lion_3_Winston_Spencer_Churchill_Defender_of_the_Realm__1940_1965__The_Last_Lion___3_" title="The Last Lion 3 Winston Spencer Churchill Defender of the Realm, 1940-1965 (The Last Lion, #3) by William Manchester" rel="noopener">The Last Lion 3: Winston Spencer Churchill, Defender of the Realm, 1940-1965</a> is a superb example. I loved all three parts of <i>Winston Churchill's</i> life story. Despite the death of <a href="https://goodreads.com/author/show/11789.William_Manchester" title="William Manchester" rel="noopener">William Manchester</a>, <a href="https://goodreads.com/author/show/6949221.Paul_Reid" title="Paul Reid" rel="noopener">Paul Reid</a> did a superb job of concluding it. It was not the same, and we couldn't expected it to be just from the fact they are two different individuals, but was exceptionally done. <br /><br />I suffered along with <i>Churchill</i> the hard first years of WWII and with each setback the English, and later the Allies, endured. It was staggering to read about the difficulties the Americans and the English faced when dealing with each other, both politically and militarily, although I should have expected it. As a matter of fact, Britain was not prepared for war as a result of the <i>appeasement</i> that prevailed in Britain before the war. At times, if we didn't know the outcome, it could lead to the impression that they could have easily lost the war. I breathed much better after things start to turn on in their favor. <br /><br />I think <i>Churchill's</i> determination to win the war and destroy Hitler, and his boldness from the start of the war, was crucial for victory. At the same time, it was astonishing to read how such a political master like him, manufactured his own downfalls. From what I understood his <i>loyalty-above-all</i> nature, besides his <i>old-fashioned</i> ways, heavily contributed to victory.<br /><i>
  <blockquote>“In many ways Churchill remained a nineteenth-century man, and by no means a common man. He fit the mold of what Henry James called in English Hours “persons for whom the private machinery of ease has been made to work with extraordinary smoothness.”</blockquote>
</i><i>Reid</i> grants the reader an comprehensive study of Churchill from WWII to his death in 1965. I enjoyed above all reading <i>Churchill</i>'s own words, that <i>Reid</i> quoted him frequently, and I often found myself amused and impressed with his genius. Churchill was obstinate in his defense of the British Empire and lived to see it crumble before he died. <br /><br /><i>The Last Lion 3</i> is not just a biography, but much more, indeed it is a superb history masterpiece. He expands his work and grants the reader glimpses on personalities as Franklin D. Roosevelt and Stalin; as well as many key military leaders such as Eisenhower. It is an exceptional work, another of my <i>all-time-favorites</i>. Not to be missed!<br /><br /></span></div></div></div></section></section><section class="ReviewCard__tags"><ul class="CollapsableList"><a

class="Formatted">In the final volume of the Churchill biography, Manchester hands over the reins to Paul Reid. Hand-picked by the great biographer after a debilitating stroke, Reid picks up with Churchill holding the reins of power as Hitler has begun his sweep across Europe. Using Manchester’s style of historical writing and attention to detail, Reid plays the storyteller of the greatest part of Churchill’s life, the Second World War. The narrative shows both triumphs and pitfalls that could turn Churchill from British statesman and hero to sell-out and defeated politician. Full of little known stories related to Churchill’s time in power, Reid masters the art of completing this major biographical tome. A must-read conclusion to a masterful biography, perfect for any reader with a passion for history and politics.<br /><br />Reid presents Churchill has a fearless leader in Volume Three, whose main focus is World War II. While the Nazis take swaths of land across Europe, Asia, and Africa, Churchill holds strong for his people and never bows to the constant assault being waged against him. Even as the bombing campaign begins in Britain itself, Churchill tries to calm his people, through radio addresses and in speeches on the floor of the House of Commons. In the early pages of the book, Reid reminds the reader that Churchill was chosen to head up a coalition government when Chamberlain failed miserably to deal with Hitler, and it is this trust placed at his feet that is tested from the outset. Churchill also keeps his War Cabinet in the loop as best he can, while trying to forge much needed alliances and keep Britain from trading in the Union Jack for the swastika. Even post-War, when Churchill’s Conservatives go down to epic defeat, he does not let that worry him. His return to power, the first Churchill Government chosen by the people, in 1951 brings about a swan song filled with popular support, as well as those around him. No matter what the political stripes one wears, respect supersedes all when it comes to Winston.<br /><br />Tied to his leadership within Britain, Churchill hones his skills as a great statesman. Reid depicts Churchill as the only man directing a war against the likes of Hitler and Mussolini while Stalin remains on the sidelines (having signed a pact of non-aggression with Hitler) and FDR hums and haws, hiding behind Congress’ Neutrality Act. By negotiating with the latter to send aid through a myriad of back channels and jumping on the opportunity to bring Stalin into the fold after the Nazis march into Russia in 1941 (a truly ironic act on Churchill’s part, as he loathes anything communist), Churchill is able to forge the Allied alliance to battle against the Nazis and eventually the Japanese to push them back and eventually nullify their gains. Reid highlights throughout the negotiation abilities of Churchill to bring about a single goal, VICTORY. Even as the Nazis are crushed and the spoils are being divides (as well as devoured by the Great Russian Bear), Churchill stays stately and tries his best to forge a post-War world in which all can live happily. Little did he know that appeasement of Stalin would forecast a lengthy standoff with the US.<br /><br />Reid presents a strong biography, latching on wonderfully to Manchester’s previous two volumes. As Reid explained to the reader in the preface, while the book was nowhere near complete, extensive notes and documents were left for him to thoroughly link Churchill’s life with the foundation laid up to 1940 Reid’s powerful narrative brings the statesman to life, highlighting some of his quirks that emerged in his youth and early adulthood. With thorough anecdotes and a powerful narrative to keep the book moving forward (note: much of the first 900 pages of the book are centred around World War II, a literary quagmire that requires a strong ability to inject impetus), Reid succeeds in enthralling the reader throughout while providing scores of teaching moments for the avid history buff.<br /><br />While the book (the entire series) is a strong biography, it is also a powerful historical narrative. Delving as deep as any book this writer has read on either World Wars or political gatherings, Reid and Manchester bring the minutiae that are glossed over by the history books to life. The intricate details of the steps leading to major decisions help the reader not only have a better understanding of the key players in the decision-making process but also the impetus for the decision. Not since reading Margaret MacMillan’s Paris 1919, has this writer seen such an attention to detail on every nation involved and the piecemeal dismantling of territory by the victors. Reid is to be commended for all his hard work in this regard, though Manchester did begin the process with some intricate discussions leading up to and including the Great War.<br /><br />As an overall series, the books are extremely powerful and take into account the ebbs and flows of Churchill’s life, both personal and political. Many people play roles in his life, coming and going at will, and none are too small to mention by either Manchester or Reid. This writer is reminded of Robert A. Caro’s work on LBJ, where they author paced himself and wrote of the intricate details of the politician’s life and personal relationships, all of which played a role in his rise to power. Any reader who has the time and is not scared by a plethora of information will surely soak up this series (both in fact) and love the outcome. Churchill is not a perfect man, nor do the authors try to make him appear to be. He is, however, a man who faced much adversity and encountered many roadblocks, around which he had to navigate in order to reach the pinnacle of his political and personal success.<br /><br />If there was a single downfall to the book (and the series?) it would be that the last 20 years of Churchill’s life turn into a roller-coaster ride, with historical blips along the way. Realising that this would violate Manchester’s promise of a trilogy must be kept in mind, but just as the first volume offers a great deal of history outside of war (and within the House), the waning years of Churchill’s life deserve adequate attention. True, the man was no longer seeking power, but it still seems a pity to relegate years to a page or two.<br /><br />Kudos to Messrs. Manchester and Reid for so spellbinding a biography. So much attention to detail went into the books and there is so much that the reader can get from them. Along with Caro, perhaps one of the best political biographies this writer has ever read.<br /><br />Long live the memory of Winston Churchill!</span></div></div></div></section></section><section

class="Formatted"><br />Manchester chose wisely.<br /><br />Having written the first two volumes of <i>The Last Lion</i>, and then taken ill, Manchester could have tried an amanuensis, could have named any of hundreds of credentialed historians, or, for that matter, could just have let the project die unfulfilled. Yet he chose Paul Reid, who came with Marines to visit the author, to talk of the war and baseball. And came, invited, again and again. Like those of us who have waited 24 years, Paul Reid must surely have known he held a sacred trust. He honored it.<br /><br />This is the best book I read this year. And it was a good year. It covers a topic (The Second World War) I know fairly well. Reid tells the story with confidence. This is not an historiography. There's no waffling based on competing scholarly opinions. This is what happened, he seems to say. I like that approach, and not just because I happened to agree with his telling.<br /><br />Churchill is here a great man. But he is wrong fully half the time, whether by the philosophy of the reader or the actual verdict of events as told by our narrator. He is painted both prescient and naive. It must have been exhausting to have dined with him.<br /><br />Always there was language. Churchill: <i>When I get to to Heaven I mean to spend the a considerable portion of my five million years in painting, and so get to the bottom of the subject. But then I shall require a still gayer palette than I get here. There will be a whole range of wonderful new colours which will delight the celestial eye</i>.<br /><br />Churchill's sarcastic barbs are well-documented. Reid reminded me of one: <i>When, in 1960, Churchill was told of Bevan's death, he mumbled a few words of moderate respect, then paused for effect before asking, "Are you </i>sure<i> he's dead?"</i><br /><br />Reid too can turn a phrase. Telling of Churchill's public forays while V-1 rockets scudded into London, Reid writes, "Although Cherwell calculated that the odds were 648,000 to one against a rocket falling on Churchill on any given night, it was a time when only optimists bought green bananas."<br /><br />I like this: <i>The alliance was looking all hat and no cattle</i>. And this: <i>Yet Churchill, in presuming that the bonhomie he found at the president's table carried weight, failed to grasp a basic tenet of American politics: good cheer is non-binding. Only the U.S. Congress can bind, and Churchill did not understand just how binding the U.S. Congress can be</i>. Oh, and this moment, with Churchill in Germany, finally, as the war was almost won: <i>Later that day, as recorded by Brooke, Churchill took himself on a long trek down to the river, where "on arrival he solemnly relieved himself in the Rhine." Brooke could only see Churchill's back, but was sure the Old Man wore a "boyish grin of contentment."</i><br /><br />Another reviewer sniffed at the audacity of someone trying to finish Manchester's work, quoting a paragraph by Manchester from one of the first two volumes as 'proof' that it would be ridiculous to try. The review seemed to be written before giving Volume 3 a chance. Surely it was written before reading this from Reid:<br /><br /><i>Sometime in the 1970s, the Fuhrer's remains were exhumed and incinerated for a second time. The ashes were flushed into the city's sewer system, where they suffered the fate of Mary Shelley's monster, </i>borne away by the wave and lost in the darkness and distance.<br /><br />One nit to pick. Reid writes, "Roosevelt (a truly religious man)...." No. First, it's the first I've ever heard anyone say that about Roosevelt. But there was no footnote or other explanation. Second, such a statement invites more discussion. What the hell does "a truly religious man" mean anyhow? Roosevelt was first a pragmatist and politician. He could lie to a man's face if it served his purpose and it often did. Refuse a boat full of Jewish refugees, knowing they would all die instead, because it would mean the loss of political capital. Reid even writes that Roosevelt "always enjoyed other people's discomfort." How does that square with a "truly religious man"? Roosevelt may have read the Book of Common Prayer, but that proves nothing. Did he read it as he committed adultery? <br /><br />As I said, just a nit. <br /><br />This is a magisterial work, magnificent. It was more than worth the wait. <br /><br /></span></div></div></div></section></section><section class="ReviewCard__tags"><ul class="CollapsableList"><a

class="Formatted">This outstanding narrative biography covers Churchill’s life from his return to government as Lord of the Admiralty soon after war broke out and on through his six years as prime minister during the war and beyond that to his death in 1965. The unfolding of the whole war from Churchill’s perspective was so compelling I almost didn’t want the book to end, despite a commitment that involved weeks with the audiobook version. It felt pretty mind expanding to be commuting along or stacking wood for the winter while being transported to the decision-making nexus around Churchill with the fate of nations at stake. All the challenges he and Britain dealt with in the management of the war effort made for quite a human story. After being on the sidelines of government for a decade, he was more than ready to drive ecstatically forward with his hopeful plans, hungry for their realization, but he often was subjected to the agonies of his schemes being thwarted and of the cost in death and disaster resulting from many of the choices made. This human element behind all the fateful trajectories of the war seems essential for me to get past the otherwise indigestible evidence pointing to a failure of civilization, the smoking gun for which is the more than 50 million lives lost. <br /><br />Reid took over the task of completing this third volume of Manchester’s trilogy on Churchill when strokes damaged his ability to write. He emulates Manchester’s narrative approach, but not his lofty style that often was laced with quirky metaphors and touches of humor. Reid noted in the introduction that Manchester was not an academic. Instead: <br /><i>He was a storyteller who made history accessible by masterful use of the dramatists’ tools—plot, setting, and character. He and I often discussed this approach, and agreed that the biographer must get out of the way of his subject, who should be placed squarely within his times and be allowed to speak and act for himself.</i><br /><br />The presentation confirms the general consensus that Churchill played a critical role in keeping up the morale and determination of Britain and her allies during the war. Also admirable was his engagement of Roosevelt in an effective way that brought essential supplies and armaments from America into the war effort through the Lend Lease program. His capacity as a military strategist and as a wise shaper of national destinies in various treaties along the way and at war’s end are more open to criticism and debate, and Reid gives plenty of fuel to both sides of these issues. And he is far from hagiography when he covers the topic of how adept or inept Churchill was in managing people and political coalitions. <br /><br />The beauty in the tale of his life is the lively interplay between the paradoxical aspects of his personality. Was he mired to his detriment in imperialist Victorian mentality, or was it the core of his strength and optimism (i.e. right making might) that allowed him to ultimately drive past all obstacles to the defeat of Hitler? Was he unrealistically optimistic or was he prescient? Time and again, the maturity that kept him on his feet gave way to a proclivity to engage in childlike imagination and play. Could it be that the former depended vitally on the latter? His talent as a persuasive and engaging speaker seemed to keep bouncing up against his hunger for bullying or his unseemly pleasure in outsmarting his opponents in debate, often involving a special genius at sarcastic irony and innuendo. Churchill could go into rages when foiled or disappointed by colleagues, but knuckling down with all his energy to the tasks at hand was his true pattern. His alcohol drinking was exaggerated according to Manchester, who speaks of him nursing a weak drink for hours, but Reid finds support for a nearly continuous and massive intake matched by some special constitution that mitigated it interfering with his functioning. Similarly, the memoir of Churchill’s doctor led Manchester to infer he was a fellow sufferer with him in frequent states of depression, but Reed makes a pragmatic argument that Churchill showed the pinnacle of mental health defined by Maslow as the state of effective self-actualization.<br /><br />Other aspects of his personality seem at odds with his accomplishments. Despite being an aristocrat used to having all menial tasks done by servants, he couldn’t resist frequently getting down and dirty, whether playing with abandon with his grandchildren or, in the quiet years, building brick walls or digging a pond at his Chartwell estate. During the Blitz, he perpetually toured bombed out neighborhoods in London after a Luftwaffe raid, connecting with the suffering of the common people. And even though he served as Defense Minister concurrently with Prime Minister, he took every available opportunity to get as close as possible to the action of a battlefield or to micro-manage battle preparations of his generals. The former reflected his tendencies in his long military history starting with his first soldiering in the Boer War. At times this aspect of his personality seemed to be the signature of a macho nut or of a regression to a child playing with toy soldiers. Yet in many cases as a leader of the war effort his tendency to take risky action in marshalling British forces to achieve an aim proved invaluable to success of battle campaigns. In other cases wiser heads prevailed when the risks outweighed the likelihood of failure. Roosevelt once remarked that Churchill would throw out 100 ideas, of which at least a couple would be brilliant. <br /><br />All these sides come out in Reid’s artful presentation from the vast materials he mined over the six years it took to complete the book. From the introduction, it is clear that the book is primarily Reid’s work as energized by years of discussion of Manchester’s outlook. His friendship with Manchester that developed after journalistic coverage of a marine veterans reunion made a doorway to helping the writer-in-residence at a liberal arts college get past his extreme writer’s block. Reid gained his confidence with a draft of the segment on the Battle of Britain, so after his strokes Manchester engaged him to finish the whole thing under his guidance. But after his death in 2004 and Reed’s inability to decipher the many boxes of coded notes from Manchester’s decade of research on the project, Reid had to go back to the same resources and forge his own path. This included transcripts of Manchester’s interviews, Churchill’s own massive account of his war years (“History will judge us kindly,” Churchill told Roosevelt and Stalin in 1943, “because I shall write the history”), transcriptions of all his speeches, and the memoirs and diaries of contemporaries, which were often critical. (For the fascinating story behind this book, see <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/04/magazine/the-fan-who-finished-william-manchesters-churchill-biography.html" rel="nofollow noopener">A Problem of Churchillian Proportions</a> from the New York Times Magazine, Nov. 1, 2012.)<br /><br />From what I read of professional reviews of this book, the critics take Reed to task for not digesting newly available materials and historical research from the many years since Manchester started on the volume. Reed also showed some limitations in understanding the British form of government. But for me as an average reader, the reading of this was a marvelous experience. I learned a lot about the history of the war for many countries, though not in the organized way which historians would present according to campaigns, themes, and interpretative positions elucidated by hindsight. Instead, the reader typically experiences events as Churchill dealt with them, with important activity occurring on many fronts and spheres simultaneously. <br /><br />At the right time we get on the world stage a man who had reason to call World War 2 the “Unnecessary War.” Warning about and standing up to Hitler had been Churchill’s clarion call for nearly ten years while on the sidelines of government, a period wonderfully covered in Manchester’s Volume 2 of “The Last Lion.” The rounds of appeasement in agreements with the Nazi government carried out by Baldwin and then Chamberlain at the helm shamefully failed in stages, as first Austria was declared a Germany’s, then Czechoslovakia was crushed, and finally Poland was invaded and divided with Russia. The French and British commitment to Poland brought them both into the war. A crisis of confidence in Chamberlain led to formation of a coalition government and entry for Churchill to join the cabinet as naval minister. For over six months there was plenty of preparation but almost no fighting save for a botched campaign to fortify Norway with British forces. The period led to some to call the situation the “Phoney War.” It was not so phoney to the Poles who experienced must slaughter of their citizenry and early imprisonment and enslavement of its Jews. Churchill was in a helpless position as he witnessed the French army make only a minor salient into Poland. Finally, with the invasion of France and Chamberlain forced to step down, Churchill’s rise to Prime Minister put him in the position to lead the war effort.<br /><br />At this point, I have to stop on details about the war as there is just too much here that fascinated me. I’ll just throw out a few questions and my leanings on them. Of most personal import to me is the question of whether I consider the pervasive bombing of German populations in cities by the Allies a war crime or was it a critical step in breaking their spirit? I come down on the former. Initially the Luftwaffe targeted military targets in England, but it took only one case of an accidental bombing of a civilian neighborhood for Churchill to unleash a prearranged agreement for the Brits to begin civilian bombing in Germany. Whereas the entire four months of the Battle of Britain resulted in about 40,000 dead, the Allied bombings in Germany caused over 300,000 deaths, with the fire bombings of Hamburg and Dresden alone causing 45,000 and 25,000 deaths respectively.<br /><br />How much was his investment in the North Africa campaign a waste of precious resources or a necessary move to prevent the Nazis taking the Suez Canal and the oil fields of the Middle East? The latter was borne out, but not the clear outcome at the time. Was he wise or foolish to keep pushing for diverting troops to the Balkans? Greece ending up outside the Iron Curtain at the end of the war can be attributed to his actions, but if he had his way maybe Bulgaria and Yugoslavia could have been vouchsafed for the Allies before Russia came sweeping in. Was he suckered by Stalin or was Churchill and Roosevelt’s negotiations and teamwork with this devil the best that could be done to win the war? The jury is still out on that one.<br /><br />I close with a few choice examples of Reid’s narrative. On his combative style of debate, Sir Ian Jacob noted that he would “debate, browbeat, badger, and cajole those who were opposed to him, or whose work was under discussion.” Reid’s summary:<br /><i>Churchill did not thrust and parry in such duels; he knew only how to thrust. Only later did it become clear that those who vehemently disagreed with him, and stated their case clearly, were those who won his respect. </i><br /><br />On how boredom was an assault on Churchill’s equanimity:<br /><i>“Idleness was a concept unknown to him,” recalled his daughter Mary. Idle ness was the handmaiden to boredom, and boredom was an enemy to be vanquished. When Chruchill found himself bored, recalled Scotland Yard’s Inspector Thompson, he became “a kicker of waste baskets, with an unbelievably ungoverned bundle of bad temper.” </i><br /><br />He quotes an insider on how the official Chequers residence was the site of “long and liquid weekends” and “nobody got as wound up unwinding as Churchill did”:<br /><i>The Old Man relaxed with a fury, and always with a quotient of wit and good cheer in inverse proportion to what might fairly be expected from a man who had just suffered a terrible week.</i><br /><br />On Churchill’s lack of punctuality:<br /><i>He was always late for trains…”Winston is a sporting man,” Clementine once told his bodyguard. “He likes to give the train a chance to get away.”</i><br /><br />How his preparations for a speech in Parliament involved intense efforts to formulate just the right phrases and last-minute shenanigans that could drive his staff nuts: <br /><i>The prelude to a speech in the House of Commons was opera bouffe. …His bath was a favorite venue for speech preparation (he was proud of being able to control the taps with his toes while he dictated). In the midst of other tasks, he would start muttering phrases to himself: “To the gates of India”; “this bloodthirsty guttersnipe”: “this star of England.” When a cabinet minister called Germans “sheep,” Churchill snarled, “<u>Carnivorous</u> sheep.” …When Hitler was the subject, Churchill struck and struck again … He fertilized every phrase with imagery, and weeded them of any word that could choke his message. He tried them out over dinner with colleagues, with different adjectives, different emphasis, to measure their rhythms and to hear how they sounded. …The climax of his ruminations would come on the day of delivery. Always at least fifteen minutes late, he might still be in bed, dictating the final draft to a typist, or inking in changes, when he should have been on his way to Parliament. Anxious whips would be telephoning him from the House, his staff would be begging him to hurry, his valet would be dressing him and flicking cigar ash from his shirt … Meanwhile, messengers held the elevator, and his chauffeur, outside, would be gunning the engine. Finally he would totter out, still dressing, tucking his spectacles and cigar case and loose cigars and his little snuffbox into sundry jacket pockets, checking the numbers pages to be sure they were in the right order.</i><br /><br />On his attitude on his buddy Lord Beaverbrook, whom he tapped to get aircraft production up by hook or by crook:<br /><i>Beaverbrook , he told Jock Colville, was “twenty-five percent thug, fifteen percent crook and the remainder a combination of genius and real goodness of heart.”</i><br /><br />On the unusual features of Air Chief Marshall Hugh Dowding, who many credit as most responsible for winning a war of attrition in the Battle of Britain but whom Churchill failed to support when proponents of large-scale definitive air battles ousted him:<br /><i>He was a difficult man to like. Ever since Trafalgar, Britons had expected their military heroes to be Nelsons, and Dowding was far from that. Tall, frail, and abstemious, he was a bird-watching widower whose career had suffered from tactlessness, unorthodox view, and a remarkable lack of social graces. That he dabbled in spiritualism and was a vegetarian only augmented the perception of his flyboys that he was a strange duck. </i><br /><br />Reid gets particularly eloquent over Churchill’s immersion in history:<br /><i>In those such as Churchill, history, by way of imagination and discipline, becomes part of personal memory, no less so than childhood recollections of the first swim in the ocean or the first day of school. Churchill did not simply observe the historical continuum; he made himself part of it. Classical venues, and Churchill’s “memory” of them—from the Pillars of Hercules and on around the Mediterranean …--informed his identity in much the same way his memories of his ancestral home, Blenheim Place, did …He may have been born a Victorian, but he had turned himself into a Classical man. He did not live in the past; the past lived on in him. Harry Hopkins, who came to know Churchill well, noted the mystical relationship he had with the past, especially the military past: “He was involved not only in the battles of the current war, but of the whole past from Cannae to Gallipoli.” Alexander the Great, Boudicca, Hadrian, King Harold, Prince Hal, Pitt, and of course his luminous ancestor Marlborough had all played their parts in earlier scenes of the same play and upon the same stage that Churchill and his enemies now played their parts.</i><br /><br />I leave you with a lasting visual image of the man to treasure:<br /><i>Churchill’s most endearing trait was also his most remarkable. He was probably the most amusing warlord in history. His very appearance could endlessly entertain his family and staff. On June 16, Colville took urgent dispatches to the P.M.’s room and “found him lying in bed, looking just like a rather nice pig, clad in a silk vest.” Smoking a long cigar and stroking his cat, Nelson, he prowled the corridors of No. 10 wearing a soldier’s steel helmet …, a crimson dressing gown adorned with a golden dragon, and monogrammed slippers complete with pom-poms.

am sorry to say that Volume 3 did not come close to the two that preceded it. Lost was Manchester's turn of the phrase and grandiose style. This volume focused far too much on the minutiae of the war and far too little on the 20 years that followed it.<br /><br />I challenge any reader to find any passage that even approaches this one from Volume I:<br /> <br />England's new leader, were he to prevail, would have to stand for everything England's decent, civilized Establishment had rejected. They viewed Adolph Hitler as the product of complex and historical forces. Their successor would have to be a passionate mannequian who saw the world as a medieval struggle to the death between the powers of good and the powers of evil, who held that individuals are responsible for their actions and that the German dictator was therefore wicked. A believer in marshall glory was required, one who saw splendor in ancient parades of victorious legions through Persepolis and who could rally the nation to brave the coming German fury. An embodiment of fading Victorian standards was wanted, a tribune for honor, loyalty, duty and the supreme virtue of action, one who would never compromise with iniquity who could create a sublime mood and thus give men heroic visions of what they were and might become. Like Adolf Hitler he would have to be a leader of intuitive genius, a born demagogue in the original sense of the word, a believer in the supremacy of his race and his national destiny, an artist who knew how to gather the blazing light of history into his prism and then distort it to his ends, an embodiment of inflexible resolution who could impose his will and his imagination on his people—a great tragedian who understood the appeal of martyrdom and could tell his followers the worst, hurling it to them like great chunks of bleeding meat, persuading them that the year of Dunkirk would be one in which it would be equally good to live or to die, who could be if necessary be just as cruel and cunning and just as ruthless as Hitler but who could win victories without enslaving populations or preaching super naturalism or foisting off myths of his infallibility or destroying or even warping the libertarian institutions he had sworn to preserve. Such a man, if he existed, would be England's last chance. In London there was such a man. <br /><br />Manchester spent the whole of Volume II building to this moment, setting the stage for Churchill to burst forward and save the civilized world. And what does Reid do with the most epic and perfect of lead ins? He gives us a bunch of facts and figures and events and dates, but never captures the essence of his subject or at least this reader's imagination. It's like Shakespeare dying after Act IV of Hamlet and having George Will write the final act. Or having John Williams finish up the last movement of the Ninth Symphony for Beethoven. Reid's effort is a serviceable, even a good biography of Churchill during the WWII years. But it is not the masterpiece that was the first two volumes.</span></div></div></div></section></section><section class="ReviewCard__tags"><ul class="CollapsableList"><a

class="ReviewText"><section class="ReviewText__content"><div class="TruncatedText"><div class="TruncatedText__text TruncatedText__text--5" data-testid="contentContainer"><div><span class="Formatted">On May 10, 1940, King George VI accepted Neville Chamberlain’s resignation as prime minister of the United Kingdom and its empire. Early that morning, Hitler had unleashed the German blitzkrieg on the Low Countries initiating the western front of the European Theater of the greatest war in human history. Before the day ended, King George had appointed the sixty-five-year-old Winston Churchill to replace Chamberlain and lead the government and its war effort to oppose Hitler. Thus, begins DEFENDER OF THE REALM, third volume of William Manchester’s masterly biography of Winston Churchill, THE LAST LION. <br /><br />Manchester died before he had written very much of DEFENDER. It was completed by Paul Reid, who worked from Manchester’s extensive notes. Knowing his time was limited, Manchester invited Reid to collaborate on DEFENDER in the apparent hope that together they would finish before Manchester’s illness disabled him. That plan did not work and Reid finished DEFENDER alone. I am happy to say that he was completely faithful to the excellence of Manchester’s first two volumes of THE LAST LION. <br /><br />Most people are familiar with Churchill’s brilliance and courage during the first year of the war against the Nazis. Almost single-handedly, he rallied the people of Britain and their government to mount a courageous defense against Hitler’s war machine when the country was shamefully ill-prepared militarily, financially and psychologically. England was isolated. France had already capitulated. The Soviet Union was steadily retreating from the German blitzkrieg in the east. And the US was reluctant to enter a European war again. England’s prestige and ability to wage war experienced a grave setback at Dunkirk. A lesser leader than Churchill would have made a deal with the Nazis and Hitler was ready to give England terms. Reid tells the story of this first year of the British war skillfully. Forgive the cliché, but this is history that reads like a novel. It is compelling even when we know the story and its outcome.<br /><br />But DEFENDER is much more than a war story. Equally fascinating is the character study focusing on the relationships between Churchill, Roosevelt and Stalin. Having saved western civilization from Nazism, Churchill was ill used by Roosevelt. Churchill and Roosevelt then were ill used by Stalin who emerges as the most Machiavellian of the three.<br /><br />Roosevelt wanted concessions from Churchill in return for America’s help. Roosevelt delayed the US's entry into the war while he negotiated with congress and Britain. Churchill was easy pickings. He had a naive and romantic faith in America. He seemed to believe that America could always be counted on to do the right thing. He envisioned a post-war world in which America and the British Empire together would preside over an enlightened world dominated by the values of western commercial democracy. While touching to me as a reader, that was not a vision shared by Roosevelt who distrusted British Imperialism. Roosevelt set in motion a number of policies intended to bring self-government to the British protectorates around the globe, including India, the shining jewel of the Empire. Churchill, burdened by his romanticized notions of America, simply failed to understand or resist Roosevelt’s policies that ultimately would undermine the Empire that Churchill dearly loved.<br /><br />Stalin out-maneuvered them both. He was willing to sacrifice countless Soviet lives in order to win a war of attrition on the eastern front. Such a strategy would have been unthinkable to the Americans or the Brits. But Stalin’s ruthless conduct of his theater of the war gave him an advantage in diplomacy. He knew that he was soaking up the majority of the Wehrmacht’s attention and that the Brits and Americans knew it too. He also sensed that the Brits and Americans were hesitant to mount a western front on mainland Europe against Hitler. So he exacted concessions in money and weaponry until the D-Day invasion. Later, then dealing with Truman and Churchill’s successor Clement Attlee, Stalin continued to exact concessions that enabled the USSR to establish most of Eastern Europe as a Soviet satellite. <br /><br />Roosevelt was dead by the time Stalin’s post-war strategy began to unfold in Eastern Europe and Churchill recognized it only after he was out of office. But once he saw Stalin’s strategy for what it was, Churchill became one of the West’s most insightful and savage critics of Soviet expansionism.<br /><br />There is so much more that could be said about this extraordinary biography. Churchill’s importance cannot be over-stated and his story is fascinating. As I read, I thought more than once that Churchill was able to rise to his unique moment in history precisely because he was from another time. He was a 19th Century man facing down the great threat of the 20th century, totalitarianism. He was singularly effective in meeting this challenge because he did not suffer from the ambiguity and fecklessness of the 20th century. His clarity and resolve was rooted in the 19th century and it may have made a better 21st Century possible for many millions of people. <br /><br />BPL: This review begs clarification on the subject of Churchill's 19th century value system and whether I admire that quality in him. <br /><br />My answer is that, in another circumstance, I would not admire it. But in the unique moment of history that he occupied, it came in pretty handy. Men of his generation in England had no humility or self-doubt about how the world should be. That gave him an advantage in rallying his country to war against the Nazis.<br /><br />Otherwise, and in most circumstances, I would not find that quality attractive in a leader. I like what Voltaire said a few centuries earlier: Doubt is an uncomfortable condition, but certainty is absurd.</span></div></div></div></section></section><section class="ReviewCard__tags"><ul

class="Formatted">Defender Of The Realm<br /><br />"Defender of the Realm, 1940 -- 1965" is the final volume of William Manchester's massive three-volume biography, "The Last Lion", of Winston Churchill (1874 -- 1965). The first volume, published in 1983, titled "Visions of Glory", covered Churchill's life from 1874 -- 1932, while the second volume, published in 1988, titled simply "Alone, covered the years 1932 -- 1940. This new sweeping third volume covers Churchill's life beginning with his ascension to the office of Prime Minister in 1940. It focuses upon the WW II years, follows Churchill during the years between 1945 and his second period as Prime Minister from 1951 -- 1955, and concludes with Churchill's years of comparative retirement up to his death. The biography was a near lifetime project for Manchester (1922 -- 2004). Manchester had researched the third volume of the trilogy, prepared well-organized and voluminous notes, and done some of the writing. Near the end of his life, however, Manchester realized he would be unable to complete the third volume. He selected journalist Paul Reid to complete the work.<br /><br />The result of Manchester's and Reid's efforts is a detailed, dense study of 1200 pages. The book offers a thorough, multi-faceted look at the complex statesman that was Winston Churchill, in his determination, devotion to Great Britain and to civilization, brilliance, and frequent pettiness. Because Churchill's personal life was inextricably intertwined with his public life, this book goes far beyond biography. It is a masterful political and military history of the WW II years and, to a lesser extent, of the years following.<br /><br />Churchill the man is most in focus in the 50-page "Preamble" to the book. Manchester and Reid offer a summation of Churchill's personality, leadership style, political, religious, and social beliefs, family and more. The Preamble offers an excellent overview to the momentous events described in the lengthy remainder of the volume.<br /><br />The volume consists of eight large parts, the first of which begins in May 1940 and follows Churchill and WW II through December, 1940. Part two covers 1941, culminating in the United States' entry into the war and on Churchill's extensive efforts to get the United States involved. Part three covers military action in 1942, focusing on the alliance between Churchill and Roosevelt. Part four covers the period November 1942 -- December 1943, as plans for the invasion of France are discussed at length and ultimately agreed to. The readers sees a great deal of Churchill, Roosevelt and his aides, and Stalin. There is extended description of Hitler's invasion of the Soviet Union. Part five covers the period between December, 1943 and the Normandy invasion in June 1944. Part six takes the narrative from Normandy to the German and Japanese surrenders. Part seven, less detailed than the earlier parts, covers the years between 1945- 1955, including Churchill's famed "iron curtain" speech in March,1946, in Fulton, Missouri, and his election as Prime Minister. The final brief part of the book covers the final ten years, 1955 -- 1965, of Churchill's long life.<br /><br />There is a great deal to be learned about Churchill, about leadership, and heroism from this book. The most eloquent, moving sections of the work are sections covering early 1940 --1941, following the evacuation at Dunkirk. Great Britain truly stood alone for more than one year and was widely expected to fall to Hitler. That it did not was due in large measure to Churchill's fortitude and strength and to the respect in which he was held by the subjects of Great Britain. The reader sees different aspects of Churchill as the war proceeds and the political and military situation develops. Manchester and Reid spend much time on the land, sea, and air wars, the different fronts in the Soviet Union, France, the Balkans, and Italy, and in the War with Japan. The book offers both a political and a military education about the events of the war years. The authors develop well the tension between the British, Churchillian view of the aims of the war and the views of President Roosevelt and the United States. The authors emphasize Churchillian's devotion to the British Empire as contrasted with the American commitment to end colonialism. Hence to overall title of the Trilogy and characterization of Churchill as "The Last Lion".<br /><br />The book is lucidly written although in its length it flags in places. In its history, it taught me much about the world in which I have lived. I also learned a great deal about the dauntless figure of Winston Churchill. The authors portray him, and properly so, as the seminal figure of the 20th Century. This lengthy, thoughtful book will be worth the attention of readers who wish to understand the 20th Century and one of the few true 20th Century heroes.<br /><br />Robin

class="ReviewText"><section class="ReviewText__content"><div class="TruncatedText"><div class="TruncatedText__text TruncatedText__text--5" data-testid="contentContainer"><div><span class="Formatted">This is a magnificent conclusion to the life of Winston Churchill. It covers the period from May 1940 to when he died in January of 1965. It is the last volume of William Manchester’s trilogy on the life of this really oversized personality. This book just shines with so many stirring passages of the events of the era – Dunkirk, the air battles that saved England, El Alamein... His interaction and conflicts with those surrounding him, like Alan Brooke (Chief of the Imperial General Staff) and Harriman (America’s Lend-Lease representative), are well rendered.<br /><br />Once he took the reigns of power Churchill is portrayed as the dominating force in England during the darkest days of World War II. After France had collapsed many felt that Hitler and Nazism were to be the New World Order. There were some in England (like Halifax) who wanted to reach an accommodation with Hitler. Not I said Churchill. He gave the voice of defiance to the Nazis – and what an eloquent voice it was. A voice that espoused liberalism and freedom in direct contrast to what was descending rapidly on Nazi occupied Europe.<br /><br />Until the German invasion of the Soviet Union Churchill’s England stood alone – and after June, 1941, Churchill made it unequivocal that England stood with Stalin’s Soviet Union against the Nazi’s. We are given a view of Churchill as a man possessed of tremendous vitality. He looked over both overall facts and minute details – much to the annoyance of his military and political staff. Unlike Roosevelt, he could not delegate. Ideas continually poured forth at meetings, conferences, discussions - which could go on and on with Churchill doing most of the impassioned talking. He would constantly juggle different projects (like an invasion of Norway, expanding the war in Italy to the Balkans...) which may be the reason why he is seen as being reluctant to have the Normandy landings. For Churchill it was not enough to have just one project going on.<br /><br />The only two individuals he could not dominate were Roosevelt and Stalin. Roosevelt, because he desperately required American military might to defeat the Nazis. Stalin, because after 1941 the Soviet Union was the main military opponent of Hitler’s Germany. Both Roosevelt and Churchill were duped and felt they could negotiate with Stalin. Stalin’s occupation of Eastern Europe showed how mislead they were.<br /><br />Of the three volumes of Churchill’s life this is the best one (in my opinion) – not only due to the stupendous world events of that time period, but the writing style is exquisite and effervescent, and this on almost every page (and this book is over 1,050 pages!).<br /><br />As a further note William Manchester (from my understanding) had little to do with the actual writing of this book. He basically left a series of disconnected interviews, notes...<br />(for more see <a target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/04/magazine/the-fan-who-finished-william-manchesters-churchill-biography.html?_r=0">http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/04/mag...</a>)<br /><br />This book is essentially the product of Paul Reid.<br /><br />Also over 900 pages (of 1,055) are concerned with World War II. There is a splendid first chapter (called “Preamble”) which covers Churchill’s worldly or philosophical outlook.<br /><br />And to make another remark, while I feel Churchill was most knowledgeable of events in Europe, I certainly do not share his views on maintaining the British Empire and colonialism.<br /><br />And a particularly stirring passage from page 490 (my volume):<br />“The honorable fight for British survival made the war great for Churchill. His faith in the rightness of his cause and the valor of ordinary Englishmen was unbounded...he had won the allegiance of almost fifty million Britons gathered around wireless sets in homes and pubs, in West End clubs, and East End warehouses. Even as Singapore tottered, and as Rommel again drove toward Egypt... polls showed that 79 percent of Britons supported Churchill. These were people who, believing that peace was worth any price, had rejoiced in Britain’s betrayal of Czechoslovakia just four years earlier. His words then had failed to move them. Had they listened then, they would not have had to listen now as he told them of one disaster after another, and reminded them that he expected that they all go down fighting in defense of their country.<br /><br />Now they listened, and Churchill persuaded them that the fate of mankind hung in the balance, and he roused their ardor, stitching the fabric of their resolution with gleaming threads of eloquence and optimism. Thus from June of 1940 to early 1942, at a time when defeat and enslavement of the Home Island seemed at first inevitable, then probable, and finally still quite possible, Churchill’s star continued to rise, to challenge the dark star of Hitler... The Fuhrer and Tojo were a pair of Genghis Kans bent upon the destruction of all that civilized men cherished. Churchill was determined to preserve it.”<br /><br /></span></div></div></div></section></section><section class="ReviewCard__tags"><ul class="CollapsableList"><a

class="Formatted">Description: <i>Spanning the years of 1940-1965, The Last Lion picks up shortly after Winston Churchill became Prime Minister—when his tiny island nation stood alone against the overwhelming might of Nazi Germany. The Churchill conjured up by William Manchester and Paul Reid is a man of indomitable courage, lightning fast intellect, and an irresistible will to action.<br><br>The Last Lion brilliantly recounts how Churchill organized his nation's military response and defense; compelled FDR into supporting America's beleaguered cousins, and personified the "never surrender" ethos that helped the Allies win the war, while at the same time adapting himself and his country to the inevitable shift of world power from the British Empire to the United States.<br><br>More than twenty years in the making, The Last Lion presents a revelatory and unparalleled portrait of this brilliant, flawed, and dynamic leader. This is popular history at its most stirring.</i><br><br><img src="https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1440718926s/746673.jpg" class="gr-hostedUserImg" loading="lazy">Book 2 is missing from my

I've read a fair amount about Churchill over the years, since reading the first two last lion books. There are a lot of good, and very good biographies of the man available.

It was staggering to read about the difficulties the Americans and the English faced when dealing with each other, both politically and militarily, although I should have expected it. As a matter of fact, Britain was not prepared for war as a result of the \u003ci\u003eappeasement\u003c/i\u003e that prevailed in Britain before the war. At times, if we didn't know the outcome, it could lead to the impression that they could have easily lost the war. I breathed much better after things start to turn on in their favor. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eI think \u003ci\u003eChurchill's\u003c/i\u003e determination to win the war and destroy Hitler, and his boldness from the start of the war, was crucial for victory. At the same time, it was astonishing to read how such a political master like him, manufactured his own downfalls. From what I understood his \u003ci\u003eloyalty-above-all\u003c/i\u003e nature, besides his \u003ci\u003eold-fashioned\u003c/i\u003e ways, heavily contributed to victory.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003e\n  \u003cblockquote\u003e“In many ways Churchill remained a nineteenth-century man, and by no means a common man.

Hand-picked by the great biographer after a debilitating stroke, Reid picks up with Churchill holding the reins of power as Hitler has begun his sweep across Europe. Using Manchester’s style of historical writing and attention to detail, Reid plays the storyteller of the greatest part of Churchill’s life, the Second World War. The narrative shows both triumphs and pitfalls that could turn Churchill from British statesman and hero to sell-out and defeated politician. Full of little known stories related to Churchill’s time in power, Reid masters the art of completing this major biographical tome. A must-read conclusion to a masterful biography, perfect for any reader with a passion for history and politics.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eReid presents Churchill has a fearless leader in Volume Three, whose main focus is World War II. While the Nazis take swaths of land across Europe, Asia, and Africa, Churchill holds strong for his people and never bows to the constant assault being waged against him. Even as the bombing campaign begins in Britain itself, Churchill tries to calm his people, through radio addresses and in speeches on the floor of the House of Commons. In the early pages of the book, Reid reminds the reader that Churchill was chosen to head up a coalition government when Chamberlain failed miserably to deal with Hitler, and it is this trust placed at his feet that is tested from the outset. Churchill also keeps his War Cabinet in the loop as best he can, while trying to forge much needed alliances and keep Britain from trading in the Union Jack for the swastika. Even post-War, when Churchill’s Conservatives go down to epic defeat, he does not let that worry him. His return to power, the first Churchill Government chosen by the people, in 1951 brings about a swan song filled with popular support, as well as those around him. No matter what the political stripes one wears, respect supersedes all when it comes to Winston.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eTied to his leadership within Britain, Churchill hones his skills as a great statesman. Reid depicts Churchill as the only man directing a war against the likes of Hitler and Mussolini while Stalin remains on the sidelines (having signed a pact of non-aggression with Hitler) and FDR hums and haws, hiding behind Congress’ Neutrality Act. By negotiating with the latter to send aid through a myriad of back channels and jumping on the opportunity to bring Stalin into the fold after the Nazis march into Russia in 1941 (a truly ironic act on Churchill’s part, as he loathes anything communist), Churchill is able to forge the Allied alliance to battle against the Nazis and eventually the Japanese to push them back and eventually nullify their gains. Reid highlights throughout the negotiation abilities of Churchill to bring about a single goal, VICTORY. Even as the Nazis are crushed and the spoils are being divides (as well as devoured by the Great Russian Bear), Churchill stays stately and tries his best to forge a post-War world in which all can live happily. Little did he know that appeasement of Stalin would forecast a lengthy standoff with the US.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eReid presents a strong biography, latching on wonderfully to Manchester’s previous two volumes. As Reid explained to the reader in the preface, while the book was nowhere near complete, extensive notes and documents were left for him to thoroughly link Churchill’s life with the foundation laid up to 1940 Reid’s powerful narrative brings the statesman to life, highlighting some of his quirks that emerged in his youth and early adulthood. With thorough anecdotes and a powerful narrative to keep the book moving forward (note: much of the first 900 pages of the book are centred around World War II, a literary quagmire that requires a strong ability to inject impetus), Reid succeeds in enthralling the reader throughout while providing scores of teaching moments for the avid history buff.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eWhile the book (the entire series) is a strong biography, it is also a powerful historical narrative. Delving as deep as any book this writer has read on either World Wars or political gatherings, Reid and Manchester bring the minutiae that are glossed over by the history books to life. The intricate details of the steps leading to major decisions help the reader not only have a better understanding of the key players in the decision-making process but also the impetus for the decision. Not since reading Margaret MacMillan’s Paris 1919, has this writer seen such an attention to detail on every nation involved and the piecemeal dismantling of territory by the victors. Reid is to be commended for all his hard work in this regard, though Manchester did begin the process with some intricate discussions leading up to and including the Great War.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAs an overall series, the books are extremely powerful and take into account the ebbs and flows of Churchill’s life, both personal and political. Many people play roles in his life, coming and going at will, and none are too small to mention by either Manchester or Reid. This writer is reminded of Robert A. Caro’s work on LBJ, where they author paced himself and wrote of the intricate details of the politician’s life and personal relationships, all of which played a role in his rise to power. Any reader who has the time and is not scared by a plethora of information will surely soak up this series (both in fact) and love the outcome. Churchill is not a perfect man, nor do the authors try to make him appear to be. He is, however, a man who faced much adversity and encountered many roadblocks, around which he had to navigate in order to reach the pinnacle of his political and personal success.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eIf there was a single downfall to the book (and the series?) it would be that the last 20 years of Churchill’s life turn into a roller-coaster ride, with historical blips along the way. Realising that this would violate Manchester’s promise of a trilogy must be kept in mind, but just as the first volume offers a great deal of history outside of war (and within the House), the waning years of Churchill’s life deserve adequate attention. True, the man was no longer seeking power, but it still seems a pity to relegate years to a page or two.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eKudos to Messrs. Manchester and Reid for so spellbinding a biography. So much attention to detail went into the books and there is so much that the reader can get from them.

Yet he chose Paul Reid, who came with Marines to visit the author, to talk of the war and baseball. And came, invited, again and again. Like those of us who have waited 24 years, Paul Reid must surely have known he held a sacred trust. He honored it.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThis is the best book I read this year. And it was a good year. It covers a topic (The Second World War) I know fairly well. Reid tells the story with confidence. This is not an historiography. There's no waffling based on competing scholarly opinions. This is what happened, he seems to say. I like that approach, and not just because I happened to agree with his telling.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eChurchill is here a great man. But he is wrong fully half the time, whether by the philosophy of the reader or the actual verdict of events as told by our narrator. He is painted both prescient and naive. It must have been exhausting to have dined with him.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAlways there was language. Churchill: \u003ci\u003eWhen I get to to Heaven I mean to spend the a considerable portion of my five million years in painting, and so get to the bottom of the subject. But then I shall require a still gayer palette than I get here. There will be a whole range of wonderful new colours which will delight the celestial eye\u003c/i\u003e.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eChurchill's sarcastic barbs are well-documented. Reid reminded me of one: \u003ci\u003eWhen, in 1960, Churchill was told of Bevan's death, he mumbled a few words of moderate respect, then paused for effect before asking, \"Are you \u003c/i\u003esure\u003ci\u003e he's dead?\"\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eReid too can turn a phrase. Telling of Churchill's public forays while V-1 rockets scudded into London, Reid writes, \"Although Cherwell calculated that the odds were 648,000 to one against a rocket falling on Churchill on any given night, it was a time when only optimists bought green bananas.\"\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eI like this: \u003ci\u003eThe alliance was looking all hat and no cattle\u003c/i\u003e. And this: \u003ci\u003eYet Churchill, in presuming that the bonhomie he found at the president's table carried weight, failed to grasp a basic tenet of American politics: good cheer is non-binding. Only the U.S. Congress can bind, and Churchill did not understand just how binding the U.S. Congress can be\u003c/i\u003e. Oh, and this moment, with Churchill in Germany, finally, as the war was almost won: \u003ci\u003eLater that day, as recorded by Brooke, Churchill took himself on a long trek down to the river, where \"on arrival he solemnly relieved himself in the Rhine.\" Brooke could only see Churchill's back, but was sure the Old Man wore a \"boyish grin of contentment.\"\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAnother reviewer sniffed at the audacity of someone trying to finish Manchester's work, quoting a paragraph by Manchester from one of the first two volumes as 'proof' that it would be ridiculous to try. The review seemed to be written before giving Volume 3 a chance. Surely it was written before reading this from Reid:\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eSometime in the 1970s, the Fuhrer's remains were exhumed and incinerated for a second time. The ashes were flushed into the city's sewer system, where they suffered the fate of Mary Shelley's monster, \u003c/i\u003eborne away by the wave and lost in the darkness and distance.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eOne nit to pick. Reid writes, \"Roosevelt (a truly religious man)....\" No. First, it's the first I've ever heard anyone say that about Roosevelt. But there was no footnote or other explanation. Second, such a statement invites more discussion. What the hell does \"a truly religious man\" mean anyhow? Roosevelt was first a pragmatist and politician. He could lie to a man's face if it served his purpose and it often did. Refuse a boat full of Jewish refugees, knowing they would all die instead, because it would mean the loss of political capital. Reid even writes that Roosevelt \"always enjoyed other people's discomfort.\" How does that square with a \"truly religious man\"? Roosevelt may have read the Book of Common Prayer, but that proves nothing. Did he read it as he committed adultery? \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAs I said, just a nit. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThis is a magisterial work, magnificent.

The unfolding of the whole war from Churchill’s perspective was so compelling I almost didn’t want the book to end, despite a commitment that involved weeks with the audiobook version. It felt pretty mind expanding to be commuting along or stacking wood for the winter while being transported to the decision-making nexus around Churchill with the fate of nations at stake. All the challenges he and Britain dealt with in the management of the war effort made for quite a human story. After being on the sidelines of government for a decade, he was more than ready to drive ecstatically forward with his hopeful plans, hungry for their realization, but he often was subjected to the agonies of his schemes being thwarted and of the cost in death and disaster resulting from many of the choices made. This human element behind all the fateful trajectories of the war seems essential for me to get past the otherwise indigestible evidence pointing to a failure of civilization, the smoking gun for which is the more than 50 million lives lost. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eReid took over the task of completing this third volume of Manchester’s trilogy on Churchill when strokes damaged his ability to write. He emulates Manchester’s narrative approach, but not his lofty style that often was laced with quirky metaphors and touches of humor. Reid noted in the introduction that Manchester was not an academic. Instead: \u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eHe was a storyteller who made history accessible by masterful use of the dramatists’ tools—plot, setting, and character. He and I often discussed this approach, and agreed that the biographer must get out of the way of his subject, who should be placed squarely within his times and be allowed to speak and act for himself.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe presentation confirms the general consensus that Churchill played a critical role in keeping up the morale and determination of Britain and her allies during the war. Also admirable was his engagement of Roosevelt in an effective way that brought essential supplies and armaments from America into the war effort through the Lend Lease program. His capacity as a military strategist and as a wise shaper of national destinies in various treaties along the way and at war’s end are more open to criticism and debate, and Reid gives plenty of fuel to both sides of these issues. And he is far from hagiography when he covers the topic of how adept or inept Churchill was in managing people and political coalitions. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe beauty in the tale of his life is the lively interplay between the paradoxical aspects of his personality. Was he mired to his detriment in imperialist Victorian mentality, or was it the core of his strength and optimism (i.e. right making might) that allowed him to ultimately drive past all obstacles to the defeat of Hitler? Was he unrealistically optimistic or was he prescient? Time and again, the maturity that kept him on his feet gave way to a proclivity to engage in childlike imagination and play. Could it be that the former depended vitally on the latter? His talent as a persuasive and engaging speaker seemed to keep bouncing up against his hunger for bullying or his unseemly pleasure in outsmarting his opponents in debate, often involving a special genius at sarcastic irony and innuendo. Churchill could go into rages when foiled or disappointed by colleagues, but knuckling down with all his energy to the tasks at hand was his true pattern. His alcohol drinking was exaggerated according to Manchester, who speaks of him nursing a weak drink for hours, but Reid finds support for a nearly continuous and massive intake matched by some special constitution that mitigated it interfering with his functioning. Similarly, the memoir of Churchill’s doctor led Manchester to infer he was a fellow sufferer with him in frequent states of depression, but Reed makes a pragmatic argument that Churchill showed the pinnacle of mental health defined by Maslow as the state of effective self-actualization.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eOther aspects of his personality seem at odds with his accomplishments. Despite being an aristocrat used to having all menial tasks done by servants, he couldn’t resist frequently getting down and dirty, whether playing with abandon with his grandchildren or, in the quiet years, building brick walls or digging a pond at his Chartwell estate. During the Blitz, he perpetually toured bombed out neighborhoods in London after a Luftwaffe raid, connecting with the suffering of the common people. And even though he served as Defense Minister concurrently with Prime Minister, he took every available opportunity to get as close as possible to the action of a battlefield or to micro-manage battle preparations of his generals. The former reflected his tendencies in his long military history starting with his first soldiering in the Boer War. At times this aspect of his personality seemed to be the signature of a macho nut or of a regression to a child playing with toy soldiers. Yet in many cases as a leader of the war effort his tendency to take risky action in marshalling British forces to achieve an aim proved invaluable to success of battle campaigns. In other cases wiser heads prevailed when the risks outweighed the likelihood of failure. Roosevelt once remarked that Churchill would throw out 100 ideas, of which at least a couple would be brilliant. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAll these sides come out in Reid’s artful presentation from the vast materials he mined over the six years it took to complete the book. From the introduction, it is clear that the book is primarily Reid’s work as energized by years of discussion of Manchester’s outlook. His friendship with Manchester that developed after journalistic coverage of a marine veterans reunion made a doorway to helping the writer-in-residence at a liberal arts college get past his extreme writer’s block. Reid gained his confidence with a draft of the segment on the Battle of Britain, so after his strokes Manchester engaged him to finish the whole thing under his guidance. But after his death in 2004 and Reed’s inability to decipher the many boxes of coded notes from Manchester’s decade of research on the project, Reid had to go back to the same resources and forge his own path. This included transcripts of Manchester’s interviews, Churchill’s own massive account of his war years (“History will judge us kindly,” Churchill told Roosevelt and Stalin in 1943, “because I shall write the history”), transcriptions of all his speeches, and the memoirs and diaries of contemporaries, which were often critical. (For the fascinating story behind this book, see \u003ca href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/04/magazine/the-fan-who-finished-william-manchesters-churchill-biography.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003eA Problem of Churchillian Proportions\u003c/a\u003e from the New York Times Magazine, Nov. 1, 2012.)\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eFrom what I read of professional reviews of this book, the critics take Reed to task for not digesting newly available materials and historical research from the many years since Manchester started on the volume. Reed also showed some limitations in understanding the British form of government. But for me as an average reader, the reading of this was a marvelous experience. I learned a lot about the history of the war for many countries, though not in the organized way which historians would present according to campaigns, themes, and interpretative positions elucidated by hindsight. Instead, the reader typically experiences events as Churchill dealt with them, with important activity occurring on many fronts and spheres simultaneously. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAt the right time we get on the world stage a man who had reason to call World War 2 the “Unnecessary War.” Warning about and standing up to Hitler had been Churchill’s clarion call for nearly ten years while on the sidelines of government, a period wonderfully covered in Manchester’s Volume 2 of “The Last Lion.” The rounds of appeasement in agreements with the Nazi government carried out by Baldwin and then Chamberlain at the helm shamefully failed in stages, as first Austria was declared a Germany’s, then Czechoslovakia was crushed, and finally Poland was invaded and divided with Russia. The French and British commitment to Poland brought them both into the war. A crisis of confidence in Chamberlain led to formation of a coalition government and entry for Churchill to join the cabinet as naval minister. For over six months there was plenty of preparation but almost no fighting save for a botched campaign to fortify Norway with British forces. The period led to some to call the situation the “Phoney War.” It was not so phoney to the Poles who experienced must slaughter of their citizenry and early imprisonment and enslavement of its Jews. Churchill was in a helpless position as he witnessed the French army make only a minor salient into Poland. Finally, with the invasion of France and Chamberlain forced to step down, Churchill’s rise to Prime Minister put him in the position to lead the war effort.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAt this point, I have to stop on details about the war as there is just too much here that fascinated me. I’ll just throw out a few questions and my leanings on them. Of most personal import to me is the question of whether I consider the pervasive bombing of German populations in cities by the Allies a war crime or was it a critical step in breaking their spirit? I come down on the former. Initially the Luftwaffe targeted military targets in England, but it took only one case of an accidental bombing of a civilian neighborhood for Churchill to unleash a prearranged agreement for the Brits to begin civilian bombing in Germany. Whereas the entire four months of the Battle of Britain resulted in about 40,000 dead, the Allied bombings in Germany caused over 300,000 deaths, with the fire bombings of Hamburg and Dresden alone causing 45,000 and 25,000 deaths respectively.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eHow much was his investment in the North Africa campaign a waste of precious resources or a necessary move to prevent the Nazis taking the Suez Canal and the oil fields of the Middle East? The latter was borne out, but not the clear outcome at the time. Was he wise or foolish to keep pushing for diverting troops to the Balkans? Greece ending up outside the Iron Curtain at the end of the war can be attributed to his actions, but if he had his way maybe Bulgaria and Yugoslavia could have been vouchsafed for the Allies before Russia came sweeping in. Was he suckered by Stalin or was Churchill and Roosevelt’s negotiations and teamwork with this devil the best that could be done to win the war? The jury is still out on that one.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eI close with a few choice examples of Reid’s narrative. On his combative style of debate, Sir Ian Jacob noted that he would “debate, browbeat, badger, and cajole those who were opposed to him, or whose work was under discussion.” Reid’s summary:\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eChurchill did not thrust and parry in such duels; he knew only how to thrust. Only later did it become clear that those who vehemently disagreed with him, and stated their case clearly, were those who won his respect. \u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eOn how boredom was an assault on Churchill’s equanimity:\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003e“Idleness was a concept unknown to him,” recalled his daughter Mary. Idle ness was the handmaiden to boredom, and boredom was an enemy to be vanquished. When Chruchill found himself bored, recalled Scotland Yard’s Inspector Thompson, he became “a kicker of waste baskets, with an unbelievably ungoverned bundle of bad temper.” \u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eHe quotes an insider on how the official Chequers residence was the site of “long and liquid weekends” and “nobody got as wound up unwinding as Churchill did”:\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eThe Old Man relaxed with a fury, and always with a quotient of wit and good cheer in inverse proportion to what might fairly be expected from a man who had just suffered a terrible week.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eOn Churchill’s lack of punctuality:\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eHe was always late for trains…”Winston is a sporting man,” Clementine once told his bodyguard. “He likes to give the train a chance to get away.”\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eHow his preparations for a speech in Parliament involved intense efforts to formulate just the right phrases and last-minute shenanigans that could drive his staff nuts: \u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eThe prelude to a speech in the House of Commons was opera bouffe. …His bath was a favorite venue for speech preparation (he was proud of being able to control the taps with his toes while he dictated). In the midst of other tasks, he would start muttering phrases to himself: “To the gates of India”; “this bloodthirsty guttersnipe”: “this star of England.” When a cabinet minister called Germans “sheep,” Churchill snarled, “\u003cu\u003eCarnivorous\u003c/u\u003e sheep.” …When Hitler was the subject, Churchill struck and struck again … He fertilized every phrase with imagery, and weeded them of any word that could choke his message. He tried them out over dinner with colleagues, with different adjectives, different emphasis, to measure their rhythms and to hear how they sounded. …The climax of his ruminations would come on the day of delivery. Always at least fifteen minutes late, he might still be in bed, dictating the final draft to a typist, or inking in changes, when he should have been on his way to Parliament. Anxious whips would be telephoning him from the House, his staff would be begging him to hurry, his valet would be dressing him and flicking cigar ash from his shirt … Meanwhile, messengers held the elevator, and his chauffeur, outside, would be gunning the engine. Finally he would totter out, still dressing, tucking his spectacles and cigar case and loose cigars and his little snuffbox into sundry jacket pockets, checking the numbers pages to be sure they were in the right order.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eOn his attitude on his buddy Lord Beaverbrook, whom he tapped to get aircraft production up by hook or by crook:\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eBeaverbrook , he told Jock Colville, was “twenty-five percent thug, fifteen percent crook and the remainder a combination of genius and real goodness of heart.”\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eOn the unusual features of Air Chief Marshall Hugh Dowding, who many credit as most responsible for winning a war of attrition in the Battle of Britain but whom Churchill failed to support when proponents of large-scale definitive air battles ousted him:\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eHe was a difficult man to like. Ever since Trafalgar, Britons had expected their military heroes to be Nelsons, and Dowding was far from that. Tall, frail, and abstemious, he was a bird-watching widower whose career had suffered from tactlessness, unorthodox view, and a remarkable lack of social graces. That he dabbled in spiritualism and was a vegetarian only augmented the perception of his flyboys that he was a strange duck. \u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eReid gets particularly eloquent over Churchill’s immersion in history:\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eIn those such as Churchill, history, by way of imagination and discipline, becomes part of personal memory, no less so than childhood recollections of the first swim in the ocean or the first day of school. Churchill did not simply observe the historical continuum; he made himself part of it. Classical venues, and Churchill’s “memory” of them—from the Pillars of Hercules and on around the Mediterranean …--informed his identity in much the same way his memories of his ancestral home, Blenheim Place, did …He may have been born a Victorian, but he had turned himself into a Classical man. He did not live in the past; the past lived on in him. Harry Hopkins, who came to know Churchill well, noted the mystical relationship he had with the past, especially the military past: “He was involved not only in the battles of the current war, but of the whole past from Cannae to Gallipoli.” Alexander the Great, Boudicca, Hadrian, King Harold, Prince Hal, Pitt, and of course his luminous ancestor Marlborough had all played their parts in earlier scenes of the same play and upon the same stage that Churchill and his enemies now played their parts.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eI leave you with a lasting visual image of the man to treasure:\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eChurchill’s most endearing trait was also his most remarkable. He was probably the most amusing warlord in history. His very appearance could endlessly entertain his family and staff. On June 16, Colville took urgent dispatches to the P.M.’s room and “found him lying in bed, looking just like a rather nice pig, clad in a silk vest.” Smoking a long cigar and stroking his cat, Nelson, he prowled the corridors of No. 10 wearing a soldier’s steel helmet …, a crimson dressing gown adorned with a golden dragon, and monogrammed slippers complete with pom-poms. \u003c/i\u003e","rating":5,"shelving":{"__typename":"Shelving","shelf":{"__typename":"Shelf","name":"read","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/4086118?shelf=read"},"taggings":[{"__typename":"Tagging","tag":{"__typename":"Tag","name":"nautical","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/4086118?shelf=nautical"}}],"webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1635893158"},"likeCount":32,"viewerHasLiked":null,"commentCount":12,"viewerCanComment({\"resourceType\":\"review\"})":null},"User:10687161":{"id":10687161,"__typename":"User","legacyId":10687161,"imageUrlSquare":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/users/1371340827i/10687161._UX200_CR0,0,200,200_.jpg","isAuthor":false,"textReviewsCount":756,"viewableName":"Andy Klein","isBlockedByViewer":false,"webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10687161-andy-klein","contributor":null,"isFollowing":false,"isFriend":false,"followersCount":6},"Review:kca://review:goodreads/amzn1.gr.review:goodreads.v1.IQuC3R668dG1TaeEhtH43w":{"id":"kca://review:goodreads/amzn1.gr.review:goodreads.v1.IQuC3R668dG1TaeEhtH43w","__typename":"Review","book":{"__ref":"Book:kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.9xyPBREP9oE2w1FrufCSeA"},"creator":{"__ref":"User:10687161"},"recommendFor":null,"updatedAt":1577815356997,"createdAt":1352230892000,"spoilerStatus":false,"lastRevisionAt":1527338753477,"text":"I am sorry to say that Volume 3 did not come close to the two that preceded it.

They viewed Adolph Hitler as the product of complex and historical forces. Their successor would have to be a passionate mannequian who saw the world as a medieval struggle to the death between the powers of good and the powers of evil, who held that individuals are responsible for their actions and that the German dictator was therefore wicked. A believer in marshall glory was required, one who saw splendor in ancient parades of victorious legions through Persepolis and who could rally the nation to brave the coming German fury. An embodiment of fading Victorian standards was wanted, a tribune for honor, loyalty, duty and the supreme virtue of action, one who would never compromise with iniquity who could create a sublime mood and thus give men heroic visions of what they were and might become. Like Adolf Hitler he would have to be a leader of intuitive genius, a born demagogue in the original sense of the word, a believer in the supremacy of his race and his national destiny, an artist who knew how to gather the blazing light of history into his prism and then distort it to his ends, an embodiment of inflexible resolution who could impose his will and his imagination on his people—a great tragedian who understood the appeal of martyrdom and could tell his followers the worst, hurling it to them like great chunks of bleeding meat, persuading them that the year of Dunkirk would be one in which it would be equally good to live or to die, who could be if necessary be just as cruel and cunning and just as ruthless as Hitler but who could win victories without enslaving populations or preaching super naturalism or foisting off myths of his infallibility or destroying or even warping the libertarian institutions he had sworn to preserve. Such a man, if he existed, would be England's last chance. In London there was such a man. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eManchester spent the whole of Volume II building to this moment, setting the stage for Churchill to burst forward and save the civilized world. And what does Reid do with the most epic and perfect of lead ins? He gives us a bunch of facts and figures and events and dates, but never captures the essence of his subject or at least this reader's imagination. It's like Shakespeare dying after Act IV of Hamlet and having George Will write the final act. Or having John Williams finish up the last movement of the Ninth Symphony for Beethoven. Reid's effort is a serviceable, even a good biography of Churchill during the WWII years. But it is not the masterpiece that was the first two volumes.","rating":3,"shelving":{"__typename":"Shelving","shelf":{"__typename":"Shelf","name":"read","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/10687161?shelf=read"},"taggings":[{"__typename":"Tagging","tag":{"__typename":"Tag","name":"political-science","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/10687161?shelf=political-science"}}],"webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/450064925"},"likeCount":31,"viewerHasLiked":null,"commentCount":12,"viewerCanComment({\"resourceType\":\"review\"})":null},"User:4384303":{"id":4384303,"__typename":"User","legacyId":4384303,"imageUrlSquare":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/users/1620760804i/4384303._UX200_CR0,0,200,200_.jpg","isAuthor":false,"textReviewsCount":191,"viewableName":"Brad Lyerla","isBlockedByViewer":false,"webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4384303-brad-lyerla","contributor":null,"isFollowing":false,"isFriend":false,"followersCount":140},"Review:kca://review:goodreads/amzn1.gr.review:goodreads.v1.A3Hv2Z8qZDZ05iUJssLOgQ":{"id":"kca://review:goodreads/amzn1.gr.review:goodreads.v1.A3Hv2Z8qZDZ05iUJssLOgQ","__typename":"Review","book":{"__ref":"Book:kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.9xyPBREP9oE2w1FrufCSeA"},"creator":{"__ref":"User:4384303"},"recommendFor":null,"updatedAt":1634388102771,"createdAt":1363441368000,"spoilerStatus":false,"lastRevisionAt":1634388102770,"text":"On May 10, 1940, King George VI accepted Neville Chamberlain’s resignation as prime minister of the United Kingdom and its empire. Early that morning, Hitler had unleashed the German blitzkrieg on the Low Countries initiating the western front of the European Theater of the greatest war in human history. Before the day ended, King George had appointed the sixty-five-year-old Winston Churchill to replace Chamberlain and lead the government and its war effort to oppose Hitler. Thus, begins DEFENDER OF THE REALM, third volume of William Manchester’s masterly biography of Winston Churchill, THE LAST LION. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eManchester died before he had written very much of DEFENDER. It was completed by Paul Reid, who worked from Manchester’s extensive notes. Knowing his time was limited, Manchester invited Reid to collaborate on DEFENDER in the apparent hope that together they would finish before Manchester’s illness disabled him. That plan did not work and Reid finished DEFENDER alone. I am happy to say that he was completely faithful to the excellence of Manchester’s first two volumes of THE LAST LION. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eMost people are familiar with Churchill’s brilliance and courage during the first year of the war against the Nazis. Almost single-handedly, he rallied the people of Britain and their government to mount a courageous defense against Hitler’s war machine when the country was shamefully ill-prepared militarily, financially and psychologically. England was isolated. France had already capitulated. The Soviet Union was steadily retreating from the German blitzkrieg in the east. And the US was reluctant to enter a European war again. England’s prestige and ability to wage war experienced a grave setback at Dunkirk. A lesser leader than Churchill would have made a deal with the Nazis and Hitler was ready to give England terms. Reid tells the story of this first year of the British war skillfully. Forgive the cliché, but this is history that reads like a novel. It is compelling even when we know the story and its outcome.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eBut DEFENDER is much more than a war story. Equally fascinating is the character study focusing on the relationships between Churchill, Roosevelt and Stalin. Having saved western civilization from Nazism, Churchill was ill used by Roosevelt. Churchill and Roosevelt then were ill used by Stalin who emerges as the most Machiavellian of the three.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eRoosevelt wanted concessions from Churchill in return for America’s help. Roosevelt delayed the US's entry into the war while he negotiated with congress and Britain. Churchill was easy pickings. He had a naive and romantic faith in America. He seemed to believe that America could always be counted on to do the right thing. He envisioned a post-war world in which America and the British Empire together would preside over an enlightened world dominated by the values of western commercial democracy. While touching to me as a reader, that was not a vision shared by Roosevelt who distrusted British Imperialism. Roosevelt set in motion a number of policies intended to bring self-government to the British protectorates around the globe, including India, the shining jewel of the Empire. Churchill, burdened by his romanticized notions of America, simply failed to understand or resist Roosevelt’s policies that ultimately would undermine the Empire that Churchill dearly loved.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eStalin out-maneuvered them both. He was willing to sacrifice countless Soviet lives in order to win a war of attrition on the eastern front. Such a strategy would have been unthinkable to the Americans or the Brits. But Stalin’s ruthless conduct of his theater of the war gave him an advantage in diplomacy. He knew that he was soaking up the majority of the Wehrmacht’s attention and that the Brits and Americans knew it too. He also sensed that the Brits and Americans were hesitant to mount a western front on mainland Europe against Hitler. So he exacted concessions in money and weaponry until the D-Day invasion. Later, then dealing with Truman and Churchill’s successor Clement Attlee, Stalin continued to exact concessions that enabled the USSR to establish most of Eastern Europe as a Soviet satellite. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eRoosevelt was dead by the time Stalin’s post-war strategy began to unfold in Eastern Europe and Churchill recognized it only after he was out of office. But once he saw Stalin’s strategy for what it was, Churchill became one of the West’s most insightful and savage critics of Soviet expansionism.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThere is so much more that could be said about this extraordinary biography. Churchill’s importance cannot be over-stated and his story is fascinating. As I read, I thought more than once that Churchill was able to rise to his unique moment in history precisely because he was from another time. He was a 19th Century man facing down the great threat of the 20th century, totalitarianism. He was singularly effective in meeting this challenge because he did not suffer from the ambiguity and fecklessness of the 20th century. His clarity and resolve was rooted in the 19th century and it may have made a better 21st Century possible for many millions of people. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eBPL: This review begs clarification on the subject of Churchill's 19th century value system and whether I admire that quality in him. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eMy answer is that, in another circumstance, I would not admire it. But in the unique moment of history that he occupied, it came in pretty handy. Men of his generation in England had no humility or self-doubt about how the world should be. That gave him an advantage in rallying his country to war against the Nazis.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eOtherwise, and in most circumstances, I would not find that quality attractive in a leader. I like what Voltaire said a few centuries earlier: Doubt is an uncomfortable condition, but certainty is absurd.","rating":5,"shelving":{"__typename":"Shelving","shelf":{"__typename":"Shelf","name":"read","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/4384303?shelf=read"},"taggings":[{"__typename":"Tagging","tag":{"__typename":"Tag","name":"favorites","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/4384303?shelf=favorites"}}],"webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/562573932"},"likeCount":15,"viewerHasLiked":null,"commentCount":2,"viewerCanComment({\"resourceType\":\"review\"})":null},"User:22269025":{"id":22269025,"__typename":"User","legacyId":22269025,"imageUrlSquare":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/users/1571353109i/22269025._UX200_CR0,33,200,200_.jpg","isAuthor":false,"textReviewsCount":1700,"viewableName":"robin friedman","isBlockedByViewer":false,"webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22269025-robin-friedman","contributor":null,"isFollowing":false,"isFriend":false,"followersCount":157},"Review:kca://review:goodreads/amzn1.gr.review:goodreads.v1.COmSnUwQn0RfWtuhjE4eoQ":{"id":"kca://review:goodreads/amzn1.gr.review:goodreads.v1.COmSnUwQn0RfWtuhjE4eoQ","__typename":"Review","book":{"__ref":"Book:kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.9xyPBREP9oE2w1FrufCSeA"},"creator":{"__ref":"User:22269025"},"recommendFor":null,"updatedAt":1632279530605,"createdAt":1481459127828,"spoilerStatus":false,"lastRevisionAt":1618917082361,"text":"Defender Of The Realm\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\"Defender of the Realm, 1940 -- 1965\" is the final volume of William Manchester's massive three-volume biography, \"The Last Lion\", of Winston Churchill (1874 -- 1965). The first volume, published in 1983, titled \"Visions of Glory\", covered Churchill's life from 1874 -- 1932, while the second volume, published in 1988, titled simply \"Alone, covered the years 1932 -- 1940. This new sweeping third volume covers Churchill's life beginning with his ascension to the office of Prime Minister in 1940. It focuses upon the WW II years, follows Churchill during the years between 1945 and his second period as Prime Minister from 1951 -- 1955, and concludes with Churchill's years of comparative retirement up to his death. The biography was a near lifetime project for Manchester (1922 -- 2004). Manchester had researched the third volume of the trilogy, prepared well-organized and voluminous notes, and done some of the writing. Near the end of his life, however, Manchester realized he would be unable to complete the third volume. He selected journalist Paul Reid to complete the work.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe result of Manchester's and Reid's efforts is a detailed, dense study of 1200 pages. The book offers a thorough, multi-faceted look at the complex statesman that was Winston Churchill, in his determination, devotion to Great Britain and to civilization, brilliance, and frequent pettiness. Because Churchill's personal life was inextricably intertwined with his public life, this book goes far beyond biography. It is a masterful political and military history of the WW II years and, to a lesser extent, of the years following.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eChurchill the man is most in focus in the 50-page \"Preamble\" to the book. Manchester and Reid offer a summation of Churchill's personality, leadership style, political, religious, and social beliefs, family and more. The Preamble offers an excellent overview to the momentous events described in the lengthy remainder of the volume.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe volume consists of eight large parts, the first of which begins in May 1940 and follows Churchill and WW II through December, 1940. Part two covers 1941, culminating in the United States' entry into the war and on Churchill's extensive efforts to get the United States involved. Part three covers military action in 1942, focusing on the alliance between Churchill and Roosevelt. Part four covers the period November 1942 -- December 1943, as plans for the invasion of France are discussed at length and ultimately agreed to. The readers sees a great deal of Churchill, Roosevelt and his aides, and Stalin. There is extended description of Hitler's invasion of the Soviet Union. Part five covers the period between December, 1943 and the Normandy invasion in June 1944. Part six takes the narrative from Normandy to the German and Japanese surrenders. Part seven, less detailed than the earlier parts, covers the years between 1945- 1955, including Churchill's famed \"iron curtain\" speech in March,1946, in Fulton, Missouri, and his election as Prime Minister. The final brief part of the book covers the final ten years, 1955 -- 1965, of Churchill's long life.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThere is a great deal to be learned about Churchill, about leadership, and heroism from this book. The most eloquent, moving sections of the work are sections covering early 1940 --1941, following the evacuation at Dunkirk. Great Britain truly stood alone for more than one year and was widely expected to fall to Hitler. That it did not was due in large measure to Churchill's fortitude and strength and to the respect in which he was held by the subjects of Great Britain. The reader sees different aspects of Churchill as the war proceeds and the political and military situation develops. Manchester and Reid spend much time on the land, sea, and air wars, the different fronts in the Soviet Union, France, the Balkans, and Italy, and in the War with Japan. The book offers both a political and a military education about the events of the war years. The authors develop well the tension between the British, Churchillian view of the aims of the war and the views of President Roosevelt and the United States. The authors emphasize Churchillian's devotion to the British Empire as contrasted with the American commitment to end colonialism. Hence to overall title of the Trilogy and characterization of Churchill as \"The Last Lion\".\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe book is lucidly written although in its length it flags in places. In its history, it taught me much about the world in which I have lived. I also learned a great deal about the dauntless figure of Winston Churchill. The authors portray him, and properly so, as the seminal figure of the 20th Century. This lengthy, thoughtful book will be worth the attention of readers who wish to understand the 20th Century and one of the few true 20th Century heroes.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eRobin Friedman","rating":5,"shelving":{"__typename":"Shelving","shelf":{"__typename":"Shelf","name":"read","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/22269025?shelf=read"},"taggings":[],"webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1836011700"},"likeCount":14,"viewerHasLiked":null,"commentCount":2,"viewerCanComment({\"resourceType\":\"review\"})":null},"User:1484029":{"id":1484029,"__typename":"User","legacyId":1484029,"imageUrlSquare":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/users/1641475883i/1484029._UY200_CR33,0,200,200_.jpg","isAuthor":false,"textReviewsCount":889,"viewableName":"Mikey B.","isBlockedByViewer":false,"webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1484029-mikey-b","contributor":null,"isFollowing":false,"isFriend":false,"followersCount":299},"Review:kca://review:goodreads/amzn1.gr.review:goodreads.v1.CGSnryWupfgTIfv9whJ5GQ":{"id":"kca://review:goodreads/amzn1.gr.review:goodreads.v1.CGSnryWupfgTIfv9whJ5GQ","__typename":"Review","book":{"__ref":"Book:kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.9xyPBREP9oE2w1FrufCSeA"},"creator":{"__ref":"User:1484029"},"recommendFor":null,"updatedAt":1617533320639,"createdAt":1380976413000,"spoilerStatus":false,"lastRevisionAt":1405120371000,"text":"This is a magnificent conclusion to the life of Winston Churchill. It covers the period from May 1940 to when he died in January of 1965. It is the last volume of William Manchester’s trilogy on the life of this really oversized personality. This book just shines with so many stirring passages of the events of the era – Dunkirk, the air battles that saved England, El Alamein... His interaction and conflicts with those surrounding him, like Alan Brooke (Chief of the Imperial General Staff) and Harriman (America’s Lend-Lease representative), are well rendered.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eOnce he took the reigns of power Churchill is portrayed as the dominating force in England during the darkest days of World War II. After France had collapsed many felt that Hitler and Nazism were to be the New World Order. There were some in England (like Halifax) who wanted to reach an accommodation with Hitler. Not I said Churchill. He gave the voice of defiance to the Nazis – and what an eloquent voice it was. A voice that espoused liberalism and freedom in direct contrast to what was descending rapidly on Nazi occupied Europe.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eUntil the German invasion of the Soviet Union Churchill’s England stood alone – and after June, 1941, Churchill made it unequivocal that England stood with Stalin’s Soviet Union against the Nazi’s. We are given a view of Churchill as a man possessed of tremendous vitality. He looked over both overall facts and minute details – much to the annoyance of his military and political staff. Unlike Roosevelt, he could not delegate. Ideas continually poured forth at meetings, conferences, discussions - which could go on and on with Churchill doing most of the impassioned talking. He would constantly juggle different projects (like an invasion of Norway, expanding the war in Italy to the Balkans...) which may be the reason why he is seen as being reluctant to have the Normandy landings. For Churchill it was not enough to have just one project going on.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe only two individuals he could not dominate were Roosevelt and Stalin. Roosevelt, because he desperately required American military might to defeat the Nazis. Stalin, because after 1941 the Soviet Union was the main military opponent of Hitler’s Germany. Both Roosevelt and Churchill were duped and felt they could negotiate with Stalin. Stalin’s occupation of Eastern Europe showed how mislead they were.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eOf the three volumes of Churchill’s life this is the best one (in my opinion) – not only due to the stupendous world events of that time period, but the writing style is exquisite and effervescent, and this on almost every page (and this book is over 1,050 pages!).\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAs a further note William Manchester (from my understanding) had little to do with the actual writing of this book. He basically left a series of disconnected interviews, notes...\u003cbr /\u003e(for more see \u003ca target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/04/magazine/the-fan-who-finished-william-manchesters-churchill-biography.html?_r=0\"\u003ehttp://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/04/mag...\u003c/a\u003e)\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThis book is essentially the product of Paul Reid.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAlso over 900 pages (of 1,055) are concerned with World War II. There is a splendid first chapter (called “Preamble”) which covers Churchill’s worldly or philosophical outlook.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAnd to make another remark, while I feel Churchill was most knowledgeable of events in Europe, I certainly do not share his views on maintaining the British Empire and colonialism.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAnd a particularly stirring passage from page 490 (my volume):\u003cbr /\u003e“The honorable fight for British survival made the war great for Churchill. His faith in the rightness of his cause and the valor of ordinary Englishmen was unbounded...he had won the allegiance of almost fifty million Britons gathered around wireless sets in homes and pubs, in West End clubs, and East End warehouses. Even as Singapore tottered, and as Rommel again drove toward Egypt... polls showed that 79 percent of Britons supported Churchill. These were people who, believing that peace was worth any price, had rejoiced in Britain’s betrayal of Czechoslovakia just four years earlier. His words then had failed to move them. Had they listened then, they would not have had to listen now as he told them of one disaster after another, and reminded them that he expected that they all go down fighting in defense of their country.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eNow they listened, and Churchill persuaded them that the fate of mankind hung in the balance, and he roused their ardor, stitching the fabric of their resolution with gleaming threads of eloquence and optimism. Thus from June of 1940 to early 1942, at a time when defeat and enslavement of the Home Island seemed at first inevitable, then probable, and finally still quite possible, Churchill’s star continued to rise, to challenge the dark star of Hitler... The Fuhrer and Tojo were a pair of Genghis Kans bent upon the destruction of all that civilized men cherished.
