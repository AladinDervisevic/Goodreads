Prize–winning biography of Harry S. Truman, whose presidency included momentous events from the atomic bombing of Japan to the outbreak of the Cold War and the Korean War, told by America’s beloved and distinguished historian.<br /><br />The life of Harry S. Truman is one of the greatest of American stories, filled with vivid characters—Roosevelt, Churchill, Stalin, Eleanor Roosevelt, Bess Wallace Truman, George Marshall, Joe McCarthy, and Dean Acheson—and dramatic events. In this riveting biography, acclaimed historian David McCullough not only captures the man—a more complex, informed, and determined man than ever before imagined—but also the turbulent times in which he rose, boldly, to meet unprecedented challenges. The last president to serve as a living link between the nineteenth and the twentieth centuries, Truman’s story spans the raw world of the Missouri frontier, World War I, the powerful Pendergast machine of Kansas City, the legendary Whistle-Stop Campaign of 1948, and the decisions to drop the atomic bomb, confront Stalin at Potsdam, send troops to Korea, and fire General MacArthur. Drawing on newly discovered archival material and extensive interviews with Truman’s own family, friends, and Washington colleagues, McCullough tells the deeply moving story of the seemingly ordinary “man from Missouri” who was perhaps the most courageous president in our history.</span></div></div></div></div><div data-testid="genresList" class="BookPageMetadataSection__genres"><ul class="CollapsableList" aria-label="Top genres for this book"><span class="BookPageMetadataSection__genre"><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/genres/biography" class="Button Button--tag-inline Button--medium"><span class="Button__labelItem">Biography</span></a></span> <span class="BookPageMetadataSection__genre"><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/genres/history" class="Button Button--tag-inline Button--medium"><span class="Button__labelItem">History</span></a></span> <span class="BookPageMetadataSection__genre"><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/genres/presidents" class="Button Button--tag-inline Button--medium"><span class="Button__labelItem">Presidents</span></a></span> <span class="BookPageMetadataSection__genre"><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/genres/non-fiction" class="Button Button--tag-inline Button--medium"><span class="Button__labelItem">Nonfiction</span></a></span> <div class="Button__container"><button type="button" class="Button Button--tag-inline Button--medium" aria-label="Show all items in the list"><span class="Button__labelItem">...more</span></button></div></ul></div><div class="BookDetails"><div class="CollapsableList"><span class="Text Text__body3"><div class="FeaturedDetails"><p data-testid="pagesFormat">1120 pages, Paperback</p><p data-testid="publicationInfo">First published June 15, 1992</p><p data-testid="awards"><span class="CollapsableList"><span data-testid="award"><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/award/show/16-pulitzer-prize">Pulitzer Prize</a>, Biography or Autobiography<span class="Text Text__subdued"> (1993)</span></span>, <span data-testid="award"><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/award/show/268-francis-parkman-prize">Francis Parkman Prize</a><span class="Text Text__subdued"> (1993)</span></span>, <span data-testid="award"><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/award/show/821-lionel-gelber-prize">Lionel Gelber Prize</a><span class="Text Text__subdued"> (1992)</span></span> <div class="Button__container"><button type="button" class="Button Button--inline Button--small" aria-label="Show all items in the list"><span class="Button__labelItem">...more</span></button></div></span></p></div></span> <div class="Button__container"><button type="button" class="Button Button--inline Button--small" aria-label="Show more book details"><span class="Button__labelItem">More details</span></button></div></div></div><hr class="Divider" role="presentation"/><div class="AuthorPreview"><div class="AuthorPreview__profile"><div class="AuthorPreview__avatar"><a class="Avatar Avatar--large" href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6281688.David_McCullough" as="div"><img data-testid="image" class="Avatar__image" alt="David McCullough" src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/authors/1429921568i/6281688._UX200_CR0,46,200,200_.jpg"/></a></div><div class="AuthorPreview__info"><h3 class="Text H3"><a class="ContributorLink" href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6281688.David_McCullough"><span class="ContributorLink__name" data-testid="name">David McCullough</span></a></h3><div class="AuthorPreview__meta"><span class="Text Text__body3 Text__subdued">44<!-- --> <!-- -->books<span class="u-dot-before">8,694<!-- --> <!-- -->followers</span></span></div></div></div><div class="TruncatedText"><div class="TruncatedText__text TruncatedText__text--3" data-testid="contentContainer"><div><span class="Formatted">David McCullough is a Yale-educated, two-time recipient of both the Pulitzer Prize (Truman; John Adams) and the National Book Award (The Path Between the Seas; Mornings on Horseback).

It was like a full time job, considering it's about 3284293842034820384238 pages long. I did it though, and for about two months or so I was a motherfucking Harry Truman expert. Then I forgot almost everything.<br /><br />Anyway, if you want seem like a history encyclopedia for a little while, take a three-day weekend and rip this bad boy open. Maybe you'll get laid.<br /><br /><br /><br />(one word of caution: reading this gave me the temerity to say "mcarthur was a giant pussy" in history class, at which point i found out that the substitute that day had served under mcarthur. apparently that's a sensitive subject. be careful)</span></div></div></div></section></section><section class="ReviewCard__tags"><ul

laughed......<br /> Cheers for the late bloomers in life!!! A man after my own heart!!!<br /><br />Harry's cousin said Harry was 'always' a late bloomer. He did everything a little later than his contemporaries. <br />He didn't marry until he was 35...so, why would it be crazy to him to first arrive in Washington in his early 50's? <br /><br /> "Harry is a fine man, intelligent, able, and has integrity. He doesn't know much about foreign affairs, but he's learning fast..." --Franklin D Roosevelt<br /><br />This book gets the reader involved! I listened to hours and hours of the audiobook--<br />I'm still not done with the audiobook. Eventually I checked out the e-book from the library to speed things along. The e-book and audiobook that I have are not synced together which is not a bad thing. I have reread and re-listened to different parts a few times, and I haven't cared one bit.....being in one part in the book - behind in the audiobook. <br /><br />Some parts are so personal -- showing us how much Truman loved his mother -respected his father--his love for his wife Bess and daughter Margaret. He was a very hard worker--loved books, music, theater, and quiet time at home. He read the Bible and was a Baptist. Truman loved 'cake' -- and hated 'guns'. There was so much 'warmth' for this man.!!!!!<br />His military experience, knowing how much he hated guns, was gut wrenching to read.<br /><br />Truman spent 10 years working on a farm - never got a formal College education... but nobody self taught himself more -- other parts give us a greater appreciation and understanding for a critical time in history when Truman was President. <br /><br />There is so much to pull out of this book --from his early life through the rise of the future President he would become - to the history of the Cold War --scandals challenges--mistakes --an understanding of the dispute between Truman and Douglas MacArthur during the Korean War . Lots of major decisions that he had to make: he had to make decisions with Churchill and Stalin shortly after Roosevelt died. He had to decide to use the atomic bomb on Japan. ....giving us the history of Hiroshima and Nagasaki --<br />We learn more about how Truman helped with general Marshall to develop the Marshall plan to revive Europe......and we got a look at the overall Republican and Democratic party machines and how they work. <br /><br />There were many times when they were situations when it was easy to see that many of the problems were a source of egos. Politicians all wanting to be leaders and be right. <br /><br />I enjoy the subtleties of the inside thoughts of Truman. For example before he was president- ( Vice President with FDR as President)....Truman wrote letters home to Bess ( his wife), saying "He so damn afraid that he won't have all the power and glory that he won't let his friends help as it should be done". <br />Truman, was a man spoke his mind... had integrity...."a straight shooter". <br /><br />Truman had been raised I'm straight answers by people who nearly always meant what they said. Roosevelt wasn't that way. --Truman never publicly expressed how he felt, but his biggest objection to President Franklin D Roosevelt was that he lied. <br />Do we need to wonder what he would think of Trump?<br /><br />It's impossible to read about past Presidents and not think about our own. <br /><br />I've watched TV episodes of "Designated Survivor", with Kiefer Sutherland. I remember the first episode, was a shock when Sutherland suddenly became President of the United States. ( zero notice). <br /><br />What was it like for Truman- to wake up one morning - no advance notice and because of the sudden death of Franklin D Roosevelt: just-like-that &gt; Truman was President?/!<br /> Oh my .... the gossip and the news.....I think would've driven me crazy:<br /> "Good God, Truman will be President", it was being said everywhere. "If Harry Truman can be president, so could my next-door neighbor". <br /><br />Others knew Truman. They knew what kind of man he was. They knew how entirely honest he was. <br />"He, of course, has the limitations upon his judgment and wisdom that the limitations of his experience produce, but I think he will learn fast and will inspire confidence. It seems to me that it is a blessing that he is President and not Henry Wallace. <br /><br />David McCullough is a master at storytelling about our Past Presidents!!! And Truman was a distinctive good man!!! <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></section></section><section class="ReviewCard__tags"><ul

was shocked that a presidential biography could be so good. Many readers had praised the Truman book, but I thought they were exaggerating. I was happy to be proven wrong.<br /><br />I think there are several reasons why "Truman" was so compelling. First and most importantly was the man himself. So epic was his odyssey that Truman seemed like a character in a novel. Harry S. Truman was born in a small town in Missouri and he grew up on a farm. He was bookish, played the piano and wore glasses, which prevented him from playing sports. He enlisted in the National Guard and fought during World War I. Then he returned home to run a clothing store, and was asked to run for county judge. Later, he became a U.S. Senator, and then he was picked to be Franklin Roosevelt's vice president in 1944. He became president when FDR died in April 1945.<br /><br />Epic and astounding, yes? Truman comes across as a decent, hardworking, loyal, honest and down-to-earth guy. It's hard not to root for him -- he was so <i>genuine</i>. <br /><br />Another reason the book was so good was the brilliance of the writing. McCullough is a skilled historian and he wove a beautiful narrative. Truman was a prolific writer of letters, and many details and quotes in the book came from those epistles. I loved the stories of Truman's courtship of his wife, Bess, of his dream to be a concert pianist, of his battle experiences during the Great War, of his senator campaign, of his unlikely path to become vice president, of his whistle stop tour. Marvelous, just marvelous stories. <br /><br />Finally, there is the knowledge that Truman was such a key figure in American and world history. He had to take command at the close of World War II, he chose to drop atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, he decided to send American troops to Korea, and he ushered in a new kind of foreign policy for the United States. Each of those events was incredibly significant and had lasting consequences.<br /><br />One aspect that I found especially interesting was how Truman handled the atomic bombs. After he became president, he was briefed on the Manhattan Project -- which had started way back in 1939 -- and was told the nuclear weapon would be ready within a few months. I had assumed there would have been some serious debate over whether to use such a bomb, but it sounded like the project was so far advanced that Truman didn't consider turning back. The goal of dropping it was to shock the Japanese into surrendering and quickly ending the war, but it was still jarring and disturbing to hear about the casualties inflicted. (Having read John Hersey's book "Hiroshima," I was picturing the devastation on the ground, and I had to pause in silence for several minutes.)<br /><br />Speaking of controversial decisions, apparently some historians have criticized McCullough for not being tough enough on Truman. It was clear that the author held the former president in high esteem, but as a reader, McCullough's narrative made it a more enjoyable book. If I wanted to read a harsh polemic on Truman's wartime and foreign policies, I wouldn't have chosen an 1,100-page biography. That's what newspaper columnists are for. <br /><br />I listened to "Truman" on audio that was narrated by McCullough, and he had a fantastic reading voice. The recording included various sound bites from Truman's speeches, which were wonderful to hear. I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves history.<br /></span></div></div></div></section></section><section class="ReviewCard__tags"><ul class="CollapsableList"><a

class="Formatted">David McCullough's work has almost everything one can wish for in a biography. After reading it, I feel as if I got to know Harry Truman personally. It is a rather voluminous book, covering Truman's childhood, early life, and extensive political career, but it is so gripping and readable you won't be able to put it down.<br /><br />As McCullough acknowledges, the writing of his outstanding work had been significantly facilitated by Truman himself: the President poured himself out on paper "with vigor and candor" all his adult life, and made it possible for the author, through the great body of surviving letters, diaries, private memoranda, and autobiographical sketches, to go below the surface, to know what he felt, what he wanted, his worries, his anger, the exceptional and the commonplace details of his days. <br /><br />Grown up in a family of farmers in Missouri, the self-educated Truman, who never attended college, had an almost ravenous interest in history. In his memoirs, he reports that as a boy he indulged in “endless reading of history,” a passion he continued as an adult. “I wanted to know what caused the successes or the failures of all the famous leaders of history.” He read Plutarch’s Lives, spent time on Abbott’s biographies of famous men, explored accounts of ancient Egypt, the Mesopotamian civilizations, Greece and Rome, ruminated on cultures of the Orient, read widely about modern nations, and tracked the drama of America’s birth and growth. His education gave him a solid grounding in his early years. But his need to earn a living soon overshadowed his academic pursuits – a career in business intervened. When he was thirty-three, however, and not having enjoyed great success, he quit his commercial work and went to France to fight in the World War I; he rose to the rank of captain. According to McCullough, that extraordinary and trying experience proved to him that he had leadership abilities. <br /><br />The most captivating part of the book, of course, begins with his miraculous election to the US Senate, which was achieved with the help of the political machine of Tom Pendergast (T.J.), the saloonkeeper whose power was "greater than that of any political boss in the country". There, on Capitol Hill, we gain the most fascinating insight into Truman's personality. While despised by many senators for being "a guy . . . sent up [to Washington] by gangsters", he persevered to prove his diligence: most mornings, he turned up at his office so early – about seven – and so in advance of everyone else in the building that it was decided he should have his own passkey, reportedly the first ever issued to a senator. Unlike most senators, Truman was no orator and made no brilliant speeches (He dared to propose his first bill after whole four months in the Senate.), but he demonstrated a strong desire to learn; he sat in the back row of the top-heavy Democratic side of the Senate at every session, listening, absorbing, learning. Later, in 1941, the gained experience combined with his straightforward personality contributed to the great success of the Truman Committee that was established to investigate all activities involving national defense. It is during the Committee's hearings that warm-hearted, easygoing Truman's persistence and toughness emerged, showing a side most people didn't know existed.<br /><br />McCullough devotes a substantial part of the biography to Harry Truman's political campaigns. Although they are maybe too detailed for my taste, they provide valuable insight into how Truman inexhaustible energy and determination. It was interesting to read about the backstairs schemes during his run for Vice President, but I won't spoil this chapter for you; it is enough to say that Roosevelt appears as impossible to decipher as ever, and this leads to some curious results...<br /><br />To say that Truman was prepared for the presidency would be an overstatement. In his twelve-week tenure as Roosevelt’s second in command, he had remained a complete outsider. By the time when, on April 12, 1945, FDR died, Truman had seen the president officially only eight times. Roosevelt had fully excluded him from his decision-making process regarding foreign affairs, this denying his green successor the needed opportunity to gain experience. While the new president wasn't as as naïve a man as some Americans suspected, he was a newbie in foreign affairs, and committed diplomatic blunders. (As the wife of Robert A. Taft, the conservative senator from Ohio, had remarked, "To err is Truman.") One of the most conspicuous was the harsh tone he adopted during a meeting with Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov; Molotov, visibly offended, took the President's behavior for a confirmation that the years of cooperation between the USSR and America had indeed ended, a perception that, in combination with other misconceptions and suspicions, would lead to the Cold War. <br />Highly challenging were the issues that Roosevelt had left Truman to untangle. For example, although the new President had been aware of the Manhattan Project since the time he headed the Truman Committee, he knew nothing of its purpose because Secretary of War Stimson had asked for permission not to reveal a secret that only four people in the world knew. One can only imagine what a bombshell revelation the possession by the USA of an atomic bomb, the most formidable weapon ever created, must have been for him. <br />Another issue was the Poland question. Since Poland was a nation with many emigrants to the States, Americans did not want it to be absorbed by the USSR, which had claimed it as a part of the proposed Soviet post-war security zone; because of public discontent, the issue turned into a political one. FDR, though, was more concerned with maintaining wartime solidarity, so he postponed the settlement of Poland's fate, thus making it the inexperienced Truman's problem, which he, exasperated by Molotov's obstinacy, handled rather undiplomatically.<br /><br />McCullough's work has one drawback that has to be noted. He pays too little attention to Truman's decision-making process in regard to a number of key episodes, such as, for instance, the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Well, the President was, indeed, silent in his journal on the fateful day he made the decision in Potsdam, and this is understandable. (Who wouldn't have been in his place?) But still... There is little information on the deterioration of Soviet-American relations and the Korean War. Truman's second term is also described primarily through his sensational campaign, a miraculous, unpredicted victory over the Republican, anti-Communist candidate Thomas E. Dewey, and through his subsequent search for a suitable Democratic candidate to success him in the White House and to continue his policy. (He tried recruiting General Dwight Eisenhower, the most popular man in the States at the time, but failed – Ike became the Republican Party's candidate instead.) <br /><br />What is a really brilliantly depicted in McCullough's biography are Truman's personal relationships with his beloved wife Bess, their adored daughter Margaret, his mother, sister Mary Jane, and cousins Ethel and Nellie Noland. Curious are also Truman's often inexplainable friendships and partnerships, such as that with the elegant, polished Secretary of State, Dean Acheson, whose place in the Cabinet was unrivaled. That Harry Truman of Missouri, product of the Pendergast machine, could possibly have anything in common with Dean Gooderham Acheson, "Groton ’11, Yale ’15, Harvard Law ’19," or feel at ease in such a partnership, struck many as almost ludicrous. At first glance, Acheson seemed to be everything the President despised, "the ultimate 'striped pants boy.'" Yet, among the "clannish and snooty" members of the State Department, which – according to Truman – were extremely bright people who made tremendous college marks but who had had very little association with actual people down to the ground, Acheson was doing a “whale of a job," and the President hoped he would never leave the government.<br /><br />In my opinion, David McCullough has also done "a whale of a job." Despite the drawback I mentioned, this is a presidential biography at its finest. It creates a uniquely wholesome picture of Harry Truman and his administration; all characters, from minor to major, are coming to life under McCullough's pen. We are always at the President's side, at his highs and at his lows; we get to know his courage, determination, candor, and occasional mistakes. Furthermore, this masterly account handles an enormous amount of of material with such deftness that one can't help but be astonished. <i>TRUMAN</i> is a long, thoroughly absorbing work that deserves much more than five stars.</span></div></div></div></section></section><section class="ReviewCard__tags"><ul class="CollapsableList"><a

class="ReviewText"><section class="ReviewText__content"><div class="TruncatedText"><div class="TruncatedText__text TruncatedText__text--5" data-testid="contentContainer"><div><span class="Formatted">Excellent read for lining up all the threads of a great leader's life in a narrative that flows like the story from a novel. Even at 1,000 pages, so much history passed through Truman's hands that major events such as the decision to bomb Hiroshima and the Korean War have to slip by with only a few pages. What comes through as a thread in the whole tapestry is the fundamental decency of the man, a pragmatism typical of farmers who face diverse challenges day by day, and a core belief in fairness for all and a distaste for wealthy privilege. His empathy for the poor was based on his own experience of the farming life and early business failures. His racist language is downplayed in relation to his efforts as president to support a Jewish State and steps toward civil rights. His political origins through the Pendergast machine in Kansas City taught him how to use and live with a patronage system, but it also seems to have given him enough knowledge of corruption and monied power to make his name exposing corruption as a senator and to be vigilant about influence buying while a president. Got to appreciate a fellow who hated Hoover and McCarthy from the get go. He saw enough war as an artillery captain in World War 1 to hate war, but was effective enough at it to inform his role as Commander in Chief during both the end of World War 2 and the Korean War. Despite a conception of Truman as hot tempered, his restraint was often remarkable. For example, the impulse to fire McArthur immediately for pushing in the media for a war with China was tempered by waiting for assessment of his value from a military perspective by the Joint Chiefs.</span></div></div></div></section></section><section class="ReviewCard__tags"><ul class="CollapsableList"><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/4086118?shelf=american-history"

class="Formatted">McCullough’s engaging portrayal of Harry Truman depicts a man of integrity, a trait rare in politicians. As president, his simple straightforward approach often led to extreme unpopularity. His inexperience and initial indecisiveness took its toll. But Harry Truman’s best quality as Clark Clifford noted, “was Harry Truman’s capacity to grow.” Thrust into a job for which he was ill prepared, Truman overcame his shortcomings working through an onslaught of difficult problems to provide genuine leadership and unlike other presidents, maintain his principles while doing it. Even though unappreciated at the time, Truman proved to be a remarkable president. <br /><br />McCullough covers every aspect of Truman’s life, but here I focus on his presidency and what I found most interesting, Truman’s ability to adapt while keeping his values. Truman’s character was shaped by hard work and hardship early in life. The same is true of LBJ. Both had fathers who failed financially making both highly motivated to succeed. Yet Truman developed morals while LBJ became Machiavellian, a difference which epitomized both their careers. <br /><br />Truman was the compromise choice for FDR’s VP in 1944, acceptable to North and South, selected primarily on lack of political vulnerabilities rather than consideration of his ability to be president. This is somewhat surprising since FDR’s ill health was well known and Henry Wallace was dumped due to pressure from those who could not picture the extreme liberal Wallace as president. FDR let others pick his running mate in one of his typical political dances even though FDR knew his own health was failing. Even more disturbing, FDR did nothing to prepare Truman to assume the presidency, only meeting with him twice and never discussing anything of substance.<br /><br />When Truman did take over, he was immediately faced with tough foreign policy issues in which he had absolutely no experience; How to end the war and deal with a postwar world with a communist Russia as a major power. His first test was meeting with Churchill and Stalin at the Potsdam conference as the war was winding down. Here, McCullough, whose affection for Truman shows throughout the book, cuts Truman some slack. He cites how well Truman prepared for his meeting with Churchill and Stalin. Truman prepared by reading background material and consulting with his Washington staff and his new Secretary of State Jimmy Byrnes, a former fellow Senator and ill-considered selection also with limited experience. Truman spent little time with his ambassador to Moscow, Averill Harriman (assisted by Kennan), who knew Stalin and Russian politics well. He also disregarded Churchill’s warnings about Stalin. Thus Truman approached Stalin idealistically thinking, as Roosevelt did before him, that he could deal with Stalin as a person of good faith. Harriman and his staff knew otherwise. Truman was completely fooled by Stalin. He thought well of Stalin and thought Stalin liked him. Stalin later told Khrushchev he thought Truman was “worthless”. Roosevelt and Truman were very different but both greatly overestimated their personal capacity to influence Stalin. Truman as he later admitted was naïve. <br /><br />Preparation and organization were not hallmarks of Truman’s early presidency. Truman reacted to problems as they came rather than rigorously organizing an agenda. His hurriedly crafted a wide ranging liberal program announced upon his return from Potsdam that was not properly vetted or politically evaluated. His lofty propositions were rejected out of hand. Truman was over his head. He neither selected a competent staff he could work with nor did he master the art of delegation. <br /><br />In foreign affairs he did not establish long term objectives around which to form a coherent policy. His indecisiveness encouraged the Soviet Union to do as it pleased and lost the respect of the American public. Stalin declared publically in February 1946 that Soviet and Western values were incompatible and another war inevitable. Truman reacted by speaking out of both sides of his mouth. Proponents of a hard line Soviet policy such as Admiral Leahy, Forrestal and Dean Acheson were sure the president agreed with them. Advocates of an accommodative policy such as Henry Wallace and Jimmy Byrnes were sure the President agreed with them. <br /><br />More telling was his equivocation over Churchill’s famous “Iron Curtain” speech at Westminster College in Fulton, Missouri March 5, 1946. Truman invited Churchill to give the speech and traveled with him to Westminster, introduced him and supported Churchill’s hard line position in prior private conversation. Then Truman backtracked publically and completely once wide spread media criticism of Churchill’s speech appeared. He even invited Stalin, who he still said he liked, to America to give his own speech which Stalin declined. Just think what would have ensued if Stalin had accepted!<br /><br />The public perception of the president as weak and befuddled weighed in domestic matters as well. In trying to resolve the 1946 railroad strike, one of many after the war, the president worked out a reasonable compromise. Truman’s top assistant, John Steelman, telling labor leaders they had to agree to a fair offer from the President of the United States, was told by them that nobody listened to this President. Ineffective in negotiations Truman decided to draft the strikers into the army. Told he was exceeding his constitutional limits, Truman responded that he wasn’t interested in philosophy. Think of a president saying that today! While the Senate voted down his proposed law, his speech to Congress was forceful and popular with the public. But this was followed by embarrassing disarray as Henry Wallace, Truman’s Secretary of Commerce, spoke out in direct contradiction of Truman’s Soviet policy. After more waffling and again looking weak, Truman finally fired Wallace, but the perception of his presidency was again one of incompetence. By the fall of 1946, his approval rating was 32%. A year earlier it had been 82%.<br /><br />Truman’s fortunes ticked up in 1947 with the appointment of George Marshall as Secretary of State. Marshall was everything Truman hadn’t been: organized, a great delegator, a good judge of men. Marshall was also a team player something the man he replaced, Jimmy Byrnes was not. Marshall was respected and his choice reflected well on Truman. He was someone who Truman could work with and who would help him. Having also made Clark Clifford White House Counsel in 1946, with State Department Undersecretary Dean Acheson playing a more prominent role, the ascendance of George Kennan’s influence, Averill Harriman, Charles Bohlen and George Elsey staying on, Truman was finally assembling a talented team. <br /><br />March 1947 marked a turning point when The Truman Doctrine advocating containment of Soviet expansion was presented to Congress and aid for Greece and Turkey requested. The Truman Doctrine was based partly on George Kennan’s famous “Long Telegram” and the internal Clifford-Elsey Report. Finally a coherent policy of how to deal with the Soviet Union was being promulgated. This was followed by formulation of the Marshall Plan which recognized America’s interest in Europe’s economic success. The National Security Act followed in July establishing the CIA, the National Security Council, and the unification of the services under the Secretary of Defense. Truman was leading with huge masterful strokes choreographed by his recently formed and exceedingly loyal staff.<br /><br />Just as he grew in his ability to craft foreign policy, so he grew in terms of Civil Rights. Coming in with a Southern heritage, in office he realized his country needed to change. He was the first president to address the NAACP. He put forward Civil Rights legislation to abolish the poll tax, outlaw lynching and support equal rights when such a stand in 1948 was unpopular with most voters. Later he issued an executive order to end discrimination in the armed forces and the civil service.<br /><br />He handled the issue of the partition of Palestine and recognition of Israel reasonably well, given a heatedly divided staff. Truman hesitated; looking wobbly again, but in the end came through. His Secretary of State, the extremely popular General Marshall, was adamantly opposed, but with deference and patience, Truman was able to get him to acquiesce and the US became the first nation to recognize Israel. This was also politically expedient. Truman’s response to the Soviet blockade of Berlin was smart and effective. The blockade could have easily led to capitulation or conversely war. Truman threaded the needle with his long term airlift which his advisors told him wouldn’t work.<br /><br />Truman’s 1948 campaign is the signature event in his career, his fortitude overcoming all odds, his persistence proving the naysayers wrong. It is unusual in national politics to see one person so right in his course, so confident in his decisions, when virtually every pundit, every poll was against him. Dewey helped, overconfident and not personable, running a lackluster campaign. Truman knew how to take advantage and he did it by standing for the things he really believed in. His authenticity connected with the American people.<br /><br />Truman’s second term brought no respite. Only restraint and persistence saw him through. Russia acquiring the atomic bomb, the decision to develop the H-bomb, the Klaus Fuchs atomic secrets spy scandal, Joe McCarthy’s lists of “communist infiltrators”, North Korea’s invasion of South Korea and last but far from least Douglas MacArthur’s public defiance. As Truman related in retrospect, he was probably too patient with MacArthur. He and the country would have been better off if he had fired MacArthur months earlier. Truman deserves kudos for leadership. Firing MacArthur was extremely unpopular and Truman accepted the heat. He wasn’t devious, no FDR shell games. He fired MacArthur straight out knowing the firestorm of protest that awaited him. <br /><br />Truman left office unloved and unwanted (22% approval, Nixon had 24% when he left office) by a public lost in McCarthyism and the tail fins growing on their cars. Only time would reveal his true legacy. Cast in a role he never envisioned, he got off to a shaky start, but in the end he held his own in the most demanding times in the most demanding job in the world even if the public did not appreciate it. And he did it the right way, without resorting to deceit, backhand deals and quid pro quos. He guided America through many complex and dangerous challenges. We in America were very fortunate to have him as our president. Truman was a great leader and McCullough’s book is a great testament to his accomplishments. <br /></span></div></div></div></section></section><section class="ReviewCard__tags"><ul

class="Formatted">ETA: I adored this book when I read it, but now my perspectives are a bit changed....... I am currently reading American Prometheus by Kai Bird. It is essential to get another view on Truman's actions and choices concerning atomic weapons, the arms race and the Cold War. To get a fuller understanding of the time and era I strongly recommend reading American Prometheus too!<br /><br />**************************************<br /><br />I listened to the audiobook format of this book, that means more than 54 hours, and I enjoyed every minute of it. Little content could have been removed. The narration by Nelson Runger was wonderful. I have complained about his slurping before, but the producers have removed the slurps. His steady clear pace perfectly matches the informative text. His intonation for Truman, was perfect, both the strength of his speeches in the presidency and his reflections, to-the-point remarks and sarcastic jokes of the elderly man. Our voice does change with age, and Runger has mastered this. (Some voices were, however, in my opinion, too low and ponderous.) At the end, and this is a book that covers all aspects of Truman’s life, from birth to death, i.e. 1884-1972, there were tears in my eyes. This is a book about a man dedicated to fighting for his beliefs, but he was a politician at heart. Keep in mind that I tend to instinctively distrust politicians. It is rather remarkable that I<b> <u>so</u></b> loved this book. I will try to never again shy away from a book about politicians……well, at least such books written by John McCullough.<br /><br />Why did I love this book? You learn about American life and values as they were when America was still a land of pioneers to what it had become by the middle of the 20th Century. What the political parties stood for has changed dramatically with time. On completion of this book you have a thorough understanding of the American party system. You travel from an agrarian Midwest value mindset through WW1, the Depression, the New Deal, WW2, the emergence of atomic weapons, the birth of the UN and NATO, the Berlin blockade and successful airlift, the Cold War and McCarthyism, the focus on civil rights, the Korean War all the way up to Kennedy’s presidency. You follow this time-period through the life of a man living through its events, and a man who as president shaped many of these events. McCullough gives you a thorough understanding of all these events and a thorough understanding of the man Truman. <br /><br />It is an honest book that never shies away from the mistakes made. I wasn’t thrilled with Truman’s friendship and dependence upon Pendergast. I felt that Truman’s relationship with his wife was at first not adequately clarified. By the end I understood Truman, all of him. I believe I comprehend both his familial relationships and the value he put on friendships, which explain his relationship with Pendergast . You see both the good and the bad. I very much admire the strength and forthrightness of Truman who was at heart a marvelous politician. Yes, definitely a politician who fought for his party and made mistakes, but dam he tried his best. Always. He never shirked his responsibilities. He never ran away from a problem, but faced them head on. He was not infallible. I still don’t understand why they never had more children……<br /><br />I was born in 1951. I understand now what my parents lived through and why they were who they were. I understand now what lead up to the world I was born into. I totally loved this book.<br /></span></div></div></div></section></section><section class="ReviewCard__tags"><ul class="CollapsableList"><a

class="ReviewText"><section class="ReviewText__content"><div class="TruncatedText"><div class="TruncatedText__text TruncatedText__text--5" data-testid="contentContainer"><div><span class="Formatted">Few presidents have made as many pivotal decisions or faced the number of history-changing events as Harry Truman -- the final five months of World War II, the Potsdam conference, the birth of atomic warfare, the post-war nationwide rail strike, the Marshall Plan, the partition of Palestine and the creation of Israel, the Czechoslovak <i>coup d'etat</i>, the Berlin Airlift, war in Korea and the relief of Douglas MacArthur, the formation of NATO, the reorganization of the U.S. defense establishment and the wartime government seizure of the steel industry. Truman faced these issues with determination, honesty, directness, and complete faith in his administration and the fundamental common sense of the American people. <br /><br />McCullough summed up Truman's story on the last page:<br /><br /><blockquote>He was the kind of president the founding fathers had in mind for the country. He came directly from the people. He <i>was</i> America. In his time, in his experience, from small town to farm to World War in far-off France in 1918; from financial failure after the war to the world of big-city machine politics to the revolutionary years of the New Deal in Washington to the surge of American power during still another terrible World War, he had taken part in the great chronicle of American life as might have a character in a novel. There was something almost allegorical about it all: The Man of Independence and His Odyssey.</blockquote><br /><br />If Truman's life was an American Odyssey, then McCullough was his Homer. He combined broad research and interviews with an engaging prose style to create a comprehensive, detailed, and easily-readable look at the life of the 33rd President of the United States. At 992 pages of text (the Simon &amp; Schuster 1st edition), it never dragged or seemed padded. McCullough's <i>Truman</i> clearly demonstrates his standing, alongside Jean Edward Smith, as one of the two leading biographers of illustrious figures in American history. Harry Truman deserved a biographer of David McCullough's skill and stature. <i>Truman</i> is certainly Five Star material in my library.</span></div></div></div></section></section><section

Who else could make a 992 page paperback biography compulsively readable? I knew essentially nothing about Harry Truman before reading this biography, and now I think he might be my favorite president. Truly a man of the people, who never let the highest office in the country go to his head, Truman made difficult decisions that would have crippled other men within the first four months of his presidency. While not all of his policies were popular during his time, most have been shown to be the right course of action in hindsight. His decision to use the atomic bomb to end World War II lay heavily on conscience, and because of that he was reluctant to ever use it again. Because of this, even with public outcry growing, he refused to use the atomic bomb or the newly developed H-bomb in Korea. Truman was a man of his principles, who put the good of the nation and the people who lived in it before the good of his own public image. I think all of our modern leaders could learn some valuable lessons about public service by following the example of Harrison S. Truman. </span></div></div></div></section></section><section class="ReviewCard__tags"><ul class="CollapsableList"></ul></section><footer class="SocialFooter"><div data-testid="stats"

good and complete biography of Truman. David McCullough describes well the political events surrounding the era and his climb to power – which was gradual but well earned. Truman was only two years younger than Roosevelt but in far better health. He was a vastly different person more prone to indiscretions. Even so he survived well in a turbulent era - the end of World War II, taking the decision to drop the atomic bomb on Japan, the commencement of the Cold War, the creation of the state of Israel (where he did waffle) and the Korean War. Truman importantly promoted the U.N.<br /><br />He was not afraid to take decisions, but he could be petulant as in writing to the Washington Post when they dared to criticize his daughter’s musical performance at a concert (this was something Roosevelt would never have done).<br /><br />I felt the author devoted too many pages to the 1948 campaign (over 60 pages). Very little was said about Truman’s efforts to desegregate the armed forces (how much opposition did this receive?) Also I am somewhat perplexed about Truman’s marriage to his wife Bess. He did marry quite late – at 35 – which is unusual in that era. Bess did not spend that much time with him in Washington during his Senate and Presidential years when he could have used the emotional support. Also they resided in her mother’s house when in Independence, Missouri. For a strong-willed individual Harry Truman seemed to be dominated by both his wife and mother-in-law.<br /><br />His firing of Douglas MacArthur is well depicted as well as his increasing frustration with Joe McCarthy – where it could be said that it was beneath presidential dignity to deal with such a scoundrel. His friendship with his staff – Clark Clifford, Dean Acheson and the illustrious George Marshall is conveyed. His growing irritation with his successor Eisenhower is interesting.<br /><br />A portrait of a warm and up-front person emerges – plus that of someone who could quickly grasp new situations and evaluate new personalities (with the exception of Josef Stalin – but he was not alone in this). He was expeditious to root out the “hangers on” of the Roosevelt administration, but did not lose site of the accomplishments of that era.<br /></span></div></div></div></section></section><section

I listened to hours and hours of the audiobook--\u003cbr /\u003eI'm still not done with the audiobook. Eventually I checked out the e-book from the library to speed things along. The e-book and audiobook that I have are not synced together which is not a bad thing. I have reread and re-listened to different parts a few times, and I haven't cared one bit.....being in one part in the book - behind in the audiobook. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eSome parts are so personal -- showing us how much Truman loved his mother -respected his father--his love for his wife Bess and daughter Margaret. He was a very hard worker--loved books, music, theater, and quiet time at home. He read the Bible and was a Baptist. Truman loved 'cake' -- and hated 'guns'. There was so much 'warmth' for this man.!!!!!\u003cbr /\u003eHis military experience, knowing how much he hated guns, was gut wrenching to read.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eTruman spent 10 years working on a farm - never got a formal College education... but nobody self taught himself more -- other parts give us a greater appreciation and understanding for a critical time in history when Truman was President. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThere is so much to pull out of this book --from his early life through the rise of the future President he would become - to the history of the Cold War --scandals challenges--mistakes --an understanding of the dispute between Truman and Douglas MacArthur during the Korean War . Lots of major decisions that he had to make: he had to make decisions with Churchill and Stalin shortly after Roosevelt died.

Many readers had praised the Truman book, but I thought they were exaggerating. I was happy to be proven wrong.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eI think there are several reasons why \"Truman\" was so compelling. First and most importantly was the man himself. So epic was his odyssey that Truman seemed like a character in a novel. Harry S. Truman was born in a small town in Missouri and he grew up on a farm. He was bookish, played the piano and wore glasses, which prevented him from playing sports. He enlisted in the National Guard and fought during World War I. Then he returned home to run a clothing store, and was asked to run for county judge. Later, he became a U.S. Senator, and then he was picked to be Franklin Roosevelt's vice president in 1944. He became president when FDR died in April 1945.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eEpic and astounding, yes? Truman comes across as a decent, hardworking, loyal, honest and down-to-earth guy. It's hard not to root for him -- he was so \u003ci\u003egenuine\u003c/i\u003e. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAnother reason the book was so good was the brilliance of the writing. McCullough is a skilled historian and he wove a beautiful narrative. Truman was a prolific writer of letters, and many details and quotes in the book came from those epistles. I loved the stories of Truman's courtship of his wife, Bess, of his dream to be a concert pianist, of his battle experiences during the Great War, of his senator campaign, of his unlikely path to become vice president, of his whistle stop tour. Marvelous, just marvelous stories. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eFinally, there is the knowledge that Truman was such a key figure in American and world history. He had to take command at the close of World War II, he chose to drop atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, he decided to send American troops to Korea, and he ushered in a new kind of foreign policy for the United States. Each of those events was incredibly significant and had lasting consequences.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eOne aspect that I found especially interesting was how Truman handled the atomic bombs. After he became president, he was briefed on the Manhattan Project -- which had started way back in 1939 -- and was told the nuclear weapon would be ready within a few months. I had assumed there would have been some serious debate over whether to use such a bomb, but it sounded like the project was so far advanced that Truman didn't consider turning back. The goal of dropping it was to shock the Japanese into surrendering and quickly ending the war, but it was still jarring and disturbing to hear about the casualties inflicted. (Having read John Hersey's book \"Hiroshima,\" I was picturing the devastation on the ground, and I had to pause in silence for several minutes.)\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eSpeaking of controversial decisions, apparently some historians have criticized McCullough for not being tough enough on Truman. It was clear that the author held the former president in high esteem, but as a reader, McCullough's narrative made it a more enjoyable book. If I wanted to read a harsh polemic on Truman's wartime and foreign policies, I wouldn't have chosen an 1,100-page biography. That's what newspaper columnists are for. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eI listened to \"Truman\" on audio that was narrated by McCullough, and he had a fantastic reading voice. The recording included various sound bites from Truman's speeches, which were wonderful to hear. I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves history.\u003cbr /\u003e","rating":5,"shelving":{"__typename":"Shelving","shelf":{"__typename":"Shelf","name":"read","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/279256?shelf=read"},"taggings":[{"__typename":"Tagging","tag":{"__typename":"Tag","name":"history","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/279256?shelf=history"}},{"__typename":"Tagging","tag":{"__typename":"Tag","name":"midwest","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/279256?shelf=midwest"}},{"__typename":"Tagging","tag":{"__typename":"Tag","name":"audiobooks","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/279256?shelf=audiobooks"}},{"__typename":"Tagging","tag":{"__typename":"Tag","name":"war","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/279256?shelf=war"}},{"__typename":"Tagging","tag":{"__typename":"Tag","name":"politics","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/279256?shelf=politics"}},{"__typename":"Tagging","tag":{"__typename":"Tag","name":"biography","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/279256?shelf=biography"}}],"webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/689359851"},"likeCount":87,"viewerHasLiked":null,"commentCount":13,"viewerCanComment({\"resourceType\":\"review\"})":null},"User:78192876":{"id":78192876,"__typename":"User","legacyId":78192876,"imageUrlSquare":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/users/1630066626i/78192876._UX200_CR0,0,200,200_.jpg","isAuthor":false,"textReviewsCount":309,"viewableName":"Stefania Dzhanamova","isBlockedByViewer":false,"webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/78192876-stefania-dzhanamova","contributor":null,"isFollowing":false,"isFriend":false,"followersCount":177},"Review:kca://review:goodreads/amzn1.gr.review:goodreads.v1.7XZmcAc1GhJj4nmUOVzXnA":{"id":"kca://review:goodreads/amzn1.gr.review:goodreads.v1.7XZmcAc1GhJj4nmUOVzXnA","__typename":"Review","book":{"__ref":"Book:kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.6d0b9C8XZ7jK2F-mk_TfpA"},"creator":{"__ref":"User:78192876"},"recommendFor":null,"updatedAt":1644099687918,"createdAt":1606766934049,"spoilerStatus":false,"lastRevisionAt":1619701394986,"text":"David McCullough's work has almost everything one can wish for in a biography. After reading it, I feel as if I got to know Harry Truman personally. It is a rather voluminous book, covering Truman's childhood, early life, and extensive political career, but it is so gripping and readable you won't be able to put it down.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAs McCullough acknowledges, the writing of his outstanding work had been significantly facilitated by Truman himself: the President poured himself out on paper \"with vigor and candor\" all his adult life, and made it possible for the author, through the great body of surviving letters, diaries, private memoranda, and autobiographical sketches, to go below the surface, to know what he felt, what he wanted, his worries, his anger, the exceptional and the commonplace details of his days. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eGrown up in a family of farmers in Missouri, the self-educated Truman, who never attended college, had an almost ravenous interest in history. In his memoirs, he reports that as a boy he indulged in “endless reading of history,” a passion he continued as an adult. “I wanted to know what caused the successes or the failures of all the famous leaders of history.” He read Plutarch’s Lives, spent time on Abbott’s biographies of famous men, explored accounts of ancient Egypt, the Mesopotamian civilizations, Greece and Rome, ruminated on cultures of the Orient, read widely about modern nations, and tracked the drama of America’s birth and growth. His education gave him a solid grounding in his early years. But his need to earn a living soon overshadowed his academic pursuits – a career in business intervened. When he was thirty-three, however, and not having enjoyed great success, he quit his commercial work and went to France to fight in the World War I; he rose to the rank of captain. According to McCullough, that extraordinary and trying experience proved to him that he had leadership abilities. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe most captivating part of the book, of course, begins with his miraculous election to the US Senate, which was achieved with the help of the political machine of Tom Pendergast (T.J.), the saloonkeeper whose power was \"greater than that of any political boss in the country\". There, on Capitol Hill, we gain the most fascinating insight into Truman's personality. While despised by many senators for being \"a guy . . . sent up [to Washington] by gangsters\", he persevered to prove his diligence: most mornings, he turned up at his office so early – about seven – and so in advance of everyone else in the building that it was decided he should have his own passkey, reportedly the first ever issued to a senator. Unlike most senators, Truman was no orator and made no brilliant speeches (He dared to propose his first bill after whole four months in the Senate.), but he demonstrated a strong desire to learn; he sat in the back row of the top-heavy Democratic side of the Senate at every session, listening, absorbing, learning. Later, in 1941, the gained experience combined with his straightforward personality contributed to the great success of the Truman Committee that was established to investigate all activities involving national defense. It is during the Committee's hearings that warm-hearted, easygoing Truman's persistence and toughness emerged, showing a side most people didn't know existed.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eMcCullough devotes a substantial part of the biography to Harry Truman's political campaigns. Although they are maybe too detailed for my taste, they provide valuable insight into how Truman inexhaustible energy and determination. It was interesting to read about the backstairs schemes during his run for Vice President, but I won't spoil this chapter for you; it is enough to say that Roosevelt appears as impossible to decipher as ever, and this leads to some curious results...\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eTo say that Truman was prepared for the presidency would be an overstatement. In his twelve-week tenure as Roosevelt’s second in command, he had remained a complete outsider. By the time when, on April 12, 1945, FDR died, Truman had seen the president officially only eight times. Roosevelt had fully excluded him from his decision-making process regarding foreign affairs, this denying his green successor the needed opportunity to gain experience. While the new president wasn't as as naïve a man as some Americans suspected, he was a newbie in foreign affairs, and committed diplomatic blunders. (As the wife of Robert A. Taft, the conservative senator from Ohio, had remarked, \"To err is Truman.\") One of the most conspicuous was the harsh tone he adopted during a meeting with Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov; Molotov, visibly offended, took the President's behavior for a confirmation that the years of cooperation between the USSR and America had indeed ended, a perception that, in combination with other misconceptions and suspicions, would lead to the Cold War. \u003cbr /\u003eHighly challenging were the issues that Roosevelt had left Truman to untangle. For example, although the new President had been aware of the Manhattan Project since the time he headed the Truman Committee, he knew nothing of its purpose because Secretary of War Stimson had asked for permission not to reveal a secret that only four people in the world knew. One can only imagine what a bombshell revelation the possession by the USA of an atomic bomb, the most formidable weapon ever created, must have been for him. \u003cbr /\u003eAnother issue was the Poland question. Since Poland was a nation with many emigrants to the States, Americans did not want it to be absorbed by the USSR, which had claimed it as a part of the proposed Soviet post-war security zone; because of public discontent, the issue turned into a political one. FDR, though, was more concerned with maintaining wartime solidarity, so he postponed the settlement of Poland's fate, thus making it the inexperienced Truman's problem, which he, exasperated by Molotov's obstinacy, handled rather undiplomatically.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eMcCullough's work has one drawback that has to be noted. He pays too little attention to Truman's decision-making process in regard to a number of key episodes, such as, for instance, the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Well, the President was, indeed, silent in his journal on the fateful day he made the decision in Potsdam, and this is understandable. (Who wouldn't have been in his place?) But still... There is little information on the deterioration of Soviet-American relations and the Korean War. Truman's second term is also described primarily through his sensational campaign, a miraculous, unpredicted victory over the Republican, anti-Communist candidate Thomas E. Dewey, and through his subsequent search for a suitable Democratic candidate to success him in the White House and to continue his policy. (He tried recruiting General Dwight Eisenhower, the most popular man in the States at the time, but failed – Ike became the Republican Party's candidate instead.) \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eWhat is a really brilliantly depicted in McCullough's biography are Truman's personal relationships with his beloved wife Bess, their adored daughter Margaret, his mother, sister Mary Jane, and cousins Ethel and Nellie Noland. Curious are also Truman's often inexplainable friendships and partnerships, such as that with the elegant, polished Secretary of State, Dean Acheson, whose place in the Cabinet was unrivaled. That Harry Truman of Missouri, product of the Pendergast machine, could possibly have anything in common with Dean Gooderham Acheson, \"Groton ’11, Yale ’15, Harvard Law ’19,\" or feel at ease in such a partnership, struck many as almost ludicrous. At first glance, Acheson seemed to be everything the President despised, \"the ultimate 'striped pants boy.'\" Yet, among the \"clannish and snooty\" members of the State Department, which – according to Truman – were extremely bright people who made tremendous college marks but who had had very little association with actual people down to the ground, Acheson was doing a “whale of a job,\" and the President hoped he would never leave the government.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eIn my opinion, David McCullough has also done \"a whale of a job.\" Despite the drawback I mentioned, this is a presidential biography at its finest. It creates a uniquely wholesome picture of Harry Truman and his administration; all characters, from minor to major, are coming to life under McCullough's pen. We are always at the President's side, at his highs and at his lows; we get to know his courage, determination, candor, and occasional mistakes. Furthermore, this masterly account handles an enormous amount of of material with such deftness that one can't help but be astonished. \u003ci\u003eTRUMAN\u003c/i\u003e is a long, thoroughly absorbing work that deserves much more than five stars.","rating":5,"shelving":{"__typename":"Shelving","shelf":{"__typename":"Shelf","name":"read","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/78192876?shelf=read"},"taggings":[{"__typename":"Tagging","tag":{"__typename":"Tag","name":"biographies","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/78192876?shelf=biographies"}}],"webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3658143835"},"likeCount":51,"viewerHasLiked":null,"commentCount":23,"viewerCanComment({\"resourceType\":\"review\"})":null},"User:4086118":{"id":4086118,"__typename":"User","legacyId":4086118,"imageUrlSquare":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/users/1567611029i/4086118._UX200_CR0,0,200,200_.jpg","isAuthor":false,"textReviewsCount":1094,"viewableName":"Michael","isBlockedByViewer":false,"webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4086118-michael","contributor":null,"isFollowing":false,"isFriend":false,"followersCount":1417},"Review:kca://review:goodreads/amzn1.gr.review:goodreads.v1.MJCmRis2WIYDmrzt14c8yQ":{"id":"kca://review:goodreads/amzn1.gr.review:goodreads.v1.MJCmRis2WIYDmrzt14c8yQ","__typename":"Review","book":{"__ref":"Book:kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.6d0b9C8XZ7jK2F-mk_TfpA"},"creator":{"__ref":"User:4086118"},"recommendFor":null,"updatedAt":1638299498799,"createdAt":1343650625000,"spoilerStatus":false,"lastRevisionAt":1436664824000,"text":"Excellent read for lining up all the threads of a great leader's life in a narrative that flows like the story from a novel. Even at 1,000 pages, so much history passed through Truman's hands that major events such as the decision to bomb Hiroshima and the Korean War have to slip by with only a few pages. What comes through as a thread in the whole tapestry is the fundamental decency of the man, a pragmatism typical of farmers who face diverse challenges day by day, and a core belief in fairness for all and a distaste for wealthy privilege. His empathy for the poor was based on his own experience of the farming life and early business failures. His racist language is downplayed in relation to his efforts as president to support a Jewish State and steps toward civil rights. His political origins through the Pendergast machine in Kansas City taught him how to use and live with a patronage system, but it also seems to have given him enough knowledge of corruption and monied power to make his name exposing corruption as a senator and to be vigilant about influence buying while a president. Got to appreciate a fellow who hated Hoover and McCarthy from the get go. He saw enough war as an artillery captain in World War 1 to hate war, but was effective enough at it to inform his role as Commander in Chief during both the end of World War 2 and the Korean War. Despite a conception of Truman as hot tempered, his restraint was often remarkable. For example, the impulse to fire McArthur immediately for pushing in the media for a war with China was tempered by waiting for assessment of his value from a military perspective by the Joint Chiefs.","rating":4,"shelving":{"__typename":"Shelving","shelf":{"__typename":"Shelf","name":"read","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/4086118?shelf=read"},"taggings":[{"__typename":"Tagging","tag":{"__typename":"Tag","name":"non-fiction","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/4086118?shelf=non-fiction"}},{"__typename":"Tagging","tag":{"__typename":"Tag","name":"history","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/4086118?shelf=history"}},{"__typename":"Tagging","tag":{"__typename":"Tag","name":"american-history","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/4086118?shelf=american-history"}},{"__typename":"Tagging","tag":{"__typename":"Tag","name":"biography","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/4086118?shelf=biography"}},{"__typename":"Tagging","tag":{"__typename":"Tag","name":"missouri","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/4086118?shelf=missouri"}}],"webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/380134455"},"likeCount":41,"viewerHasLiked":null,"commentCount":11,"viewerCanComment({\"resourceType\":\"review\"})":null},"User:8079403":{"id":8079403,"__typename":"User","legacyId":8079403,"imageUrlSquare":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/users/1625519120i/8079403._UX200_CR0,33,200,200_.jpg","isAuthor":false,"textReviewsCount":320,"viewableName":"Max","isBlockedByViewer":false,"webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8079403-max","contributor":null,"isFollowing":false,"isFriend":false,"followersCount":235},"Review:kca://review:goodreads/amzn1.gr.review:goodreads.v1.r_woI-tkCGLc7q2DoydxFw":{"id":"kca://review:goodreads/amzn1.gr.review:goodreads.v1.r_woI-tkCGLc7q2DoydxFw","__typename":"Review","book":{"__ref":"Book:kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.6d0b9C8XZ7jK2F-mk_TfpA"},"creator":{"__ref":"User:8079403"},"recommendFor":null,"updatedAt":1638299516659,"createdAt":1418314449000,"spoilerStatus":false,"lastRevisionAt":1419869418000,"text":"McCullough’s engaging portrayal of Harry Truman depicts a man of integrity, a trait rare in politicians. As president, his simple straightforward approach often led to extreme unpopularity. His inexperience and initial indecisiveness took its toll. But Harry Truman’s best quality as Clark Clifford noted, “was Harry Truman’s capacity to grow.” Thrust into a job for which he was ill prepared, Truman overcame his shortcomings working through an onslaught of difficult problems to provide genuine leadership and unlike other presidents, maintain his principles while doing it. Even though unappreciated at the time, Truman proved to be a remarkable president. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eMcCullough covers every aspect of Truman’s life, but here I focus on his presidency and what I found most interesting, Truman’s ability to adapt while keeping his values. Truman’s character was shaped by hard work and hardship early in life. The same is true of LBJ. Both had fathers who failed financially making both highly motivated to succeed. Yet Truman developed morals while LBJ became Machiavellian, a difference which epitomized both their careers. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eTruman was the compromise choice for FDR’s VP in 1944, acceptable to North and South, selected primarily on lack of political vulnerabilities rather than consideration of his ability to be president. This is somewhat surprising since FDR’s ill health was well known and Henry Wallace was dumped due to pressure from those who could not picture the extreme liberal Wallace as president. FDR let others pick his running mate in one of his typical political dances even though FDR knew his own health was failing. Even more disturbing, FDR did nothing to prepare Truman to assume the presidency, only meeting with him twice and never discussing anything of substance.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eWhen Truman did take over, he was immediately faced with tough foreign policy issues in which he had absolutely no experience; How to end the war and deal with a postwar world with a communist Russia as a major power. His first test was meeting with Churchill and Stalin at the Potsdam conference as the war was winding down. Here, McCullough, whose affection for Truman shows throughout the book, cuts Truman some slack. He cites how well Truman prepared for his meeting with Churchill and Stalin. Truman prepared by reading background material and consulting with his Washington staff and his new Secretary of State Jimmy Byrnes, a former fellow Senator and ill-considered selection also with limited experience. Truman spent little time with his ambassador to Moscow, Averill Harriman (assisted by Kennan), who knew Stalin and Russian politics well. He also disregarded Churchill’s warnings about Stalin. Thus Truman approached Stalin idealistically thinking, as Roosevelt did before him, that he could deal with Stalin as a person of good faith. Harriman and his staff knew otherwise. Truman was completely fooled by Stalin. He thought well of Stalin and thought Stalin liked him. Stalin later told Khrushchev he thought Truman was “worthless”. Roosevelt and Truman were very different but both greatly overestimated their personal capacity to influence Stalin. Truman as he later admitted was naïve. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003ePreparation and organization were not hallmarks of Truman’s early presidency. Truman reacted to problems as they came rather than rigorously organizing an agenda. His hurriedly crafted a wide ranging liberal program announced upon his return from Potsdam that was not properly vetted or politically evaluated. His lofty propositions were rejected out of hand. Truman was over his head. He neither selected a competent staff he could work with nor did he master the art of delegation. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eIn foreign affairs he did not establish long term objectives around which to form a coherent policy. His indecisiveness encouraged the Soviet Union to do as it pleased and lost the respect of the American public. Stalin declared publically in February 1946 that Soviet and Western values were incompatible and another war inevitable. Truman reacted by speaking out of both sides of his mouth. Proponents of a hard line Soviet policy such as Admiral Leahy, Forrestal and Dean Acheson were sure the president agreed with them. Advocates of an accommodative policy such as Henry Wallace and Jimmy Byrnes were sure the President agreed with them. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eMore telling was his equivocation over Churchill’s famous “Iron Curtain” speech at Westminster College in Fulton, Missouri March 5, 1946. Truman invited Churchill to give the speech and traveled with him to Westminster, introduced him and supported Churchill’s hard line position in prior private conversation. Then Truman backtracked publically and completely once wide spread media criticism of Churchill’s speech appeared. He even invited Stalin, who he still said he liked, to America to give his own speech which Stalin declined. Just think what would have ensued if Stalin had accepted!\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe public perception of the president as weak and befuddled weighed in domestic matters as well. In trying to resolve the 1946 railroad strike, one of many after the war, the president worked out a reasonable compromise. Truman’s top assistant, John Steelman, telling labor leaders they had to agree to a fair offer from the President of the United States, was told by them that nobody listened to this President. Ineffective in negotiations Truman decided to draft the strikers into the army. Told he was exceeding his constitutional limits, Truman responded that he wasn’t interested in philosophy. Think of a president saying that today! While the Senate voted down his proposed law, his speech to Congress was forceful and popular with the public. But this was followed by embarrassing disarray as Henry Wallace, Truman’s Secretary of Commerce, spoke out in direct contradiction of Truman’s Soviet policy. After more waffling and again looking weak, Truman finally fired Wallace, but the perception of his presidency was again one of incompetence. By the fall of 1946, his approval rating was 32%. A year earlier it had been 82%.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eTruman’s fortunes ticked up in 1947 with the appointment of George Marshall as Secretary of State. Marshall was everything Truman hadn’t been: organized, a great delegator, a good judge of men. Marshall was also a team player something the man he replaced, Jimmy Byrnes was not. Marshall was respected and his choice reflected well on Truman. He was someone who Truman could work with and who would help him. Having also made Clark Clifford White House Counsel in 1946, with State Department Undersecretary Dean Acheson playing a more prominent role, the ascendance of George Kennan’s influence, Averill Harriman, Charles Bohlen and George Elsey staying on, Truman was finally assembling a talented team. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eMarch 1947 marked a turning point when The Truman Doctrine advocating containment of Soviet expansion was presented to Congress and aid for Greece and Turkey requested. The Truman Doctrine was based partly on George Kennan’s famous “Long Telegram” and the internal Clifford-Elsey Report. Finally a coherent policy of how to deal with the Soviet Union was being promulgated. This was followed by formulation of the Marshall Plan which recognized America’s interest in Europe’s economic success. The National Security Act followed in July establishing the CIA, the National Security Council, and the unification of the services under the Secretary of Defense. Truman was leading with huge masterful strokes choreographed by his recently formed and exceedingly loyal staff.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eJust as he grew in his ability to craft foreign policy, so he grew in terms of Civil Rights. Coming in with a Southern heritage, in office he realized his country needed to change. He was the first president to address the NAACP. He put forward Civil Rights legislation to abolish the poll tax, outlaw lynching and support equal rights when such a stand in 1948 was unpopular with most voters. Later he issued an executive order to end discrimination in the armed forces and the civil service.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eHe handled the issue of the partition of Palestine and recognition of Israel reasonably well, given a heatedly divided staff. Truman hesitated; looking wobbly again, but in the end came through. His Secretary of State, the extremely popular General Marshall, was adamantly opposed, but with deference and patience, Truman was able to get him to acquiesce and the US became the first nation to recognize Israel. This was also politically expedient. Truman’s response to the Soviet blockade of Berlin was smart and effective. The blockade could have easily led to capitulation or conversely war. Truman threaded the needle with his long term airlift which his advisors told him wouldn’t work.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eTruman’s 1948 campaign is the signature event in his career, his fortitude overcoming all odds, his persistence proving the naysayers wrong. It is unusual in national politics to see one person so right in his course, so confident in his decisions, when virtually every pundit, every poll was against him. Dewey helped, overconfident and not personable, running a lackluster campaign. Truman knew how to take advantage and he did it by standing for the things he really believed in. His authenticity connected with the American people.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eTruman’s second term brought no respite. Only restraint and persistence saw him through. Russia acquiring the atomic bomb, the decision to develop the H-bomb, the Klaus Fuchs atomic secrets spy scandal, Joe McCarthy’s lists of “communist infiltrators”, North Korea’s invasion of South Korea and last but far from least Douglas MacArthur’s public defiance. As Truman related in retrospect, he was probably too patient with MacArthur. He and the country would have been better off if he had fired MacArthur months earlier. Truman deserves kudos for leadership. Firing MacArthur was extremely unpopular and Truman accepted the heat. He wasn’t devious, no FDR shell games. He fired MacArthur straight out knowing the firestorm of protest that awaited him. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eTruman left office unloved and unwanted (22% approval, Nixon had 24% when he left office) by a public lost in McCarthyism and the tail fins growing on their cars. Only time would reveal his true legacy. Cast in a role he never envisioned, he got off to a shaky start, but in the end he held his own in the most demanding times in the most demanding job in the world even if the public did not appreciate it. And he did it the right way, without resorting to deceit, backhand deals and quid pro quos. He guided America through many complex and dangerous challenges. We in America were very fortunate to have him as our president. Truman was a great leader and McCullough’s book is a great testament to his accomplishments. \u003cbr /\u003e","rating":5,"shelving":{"__typename":"Shelving","shelf":{"__typename":"Shelf","name":"read","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/8079403?shelf=read"},"taggings":[{"__typename":"Tagging","tag":{"__typename":"Tag","name":"american-recent-history","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/8079403?shelf=american-recent-history"}}],"webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1129193684"},"likeCount":40,"viewerHasLiked":null,"commentCount":28,"viewerCanComment({\"resourceType\":\"review\"})":null},"Book:kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.EF_eoI5G7lC5GqLpXx9liQ":{"id":"kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.EF_eoI5G7lC5GqLpXx9liQ","__typename":"Book"},"User:632247":{"id":632247,"__typename":"User","legacyId":632247,"imageUrlSquare":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/users/1321799585i/632247._UX200_CR0,33,200,200_.jpg","isAuthor":false,"textReviewsCount":2431,"viewableName":"Chrissie","isBlockedByViewer":false,"webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/632247-chrissie","contributor":null,"isFollowing":false,"isFriend":false,"followersCount":1474},"Review:kca://review:goodreads/amzn1.gr.review:goodreads.v1.TiqXrBTFg04uHhuSzsdGlQ":{"id":"kca://review:goodreads/amzn1.gr.review:goodreads.v1.TiqXrBTFg04uHhuSzsdGlQ","__typename":"Review","book":{"__ref":"Book:kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.EF_eoI5G7lC5GqLpXx9liQ"},"creator":{"__ref":"User:632247"},"recommendFor":null,"updatedAt":1627108420713,"createdAt":1365183966000,"spoilerStatus":false,"lastRevisionAt":1382462003000,"text":"ETA: I adored this book when I read it, but now my perspectives are a bit changed.......

Little content could have been removed. The narration by Nelson Runger was wonderful. I have complained about his slurping before, but the producers have removed the slurps. His steady clear pace perfectly matches the informative text. His intonation for Truman, was perfect, both the strength of his speeches in the presidency and his reflections, to-the-point remarks and sarcastic jokes of the elderly man. Our voice does change with age, and Runger has mastered this. (Some voices were, however, in my opinion, too low and ponderous.) At the end, and this is a book that covers all aspects of Truman’s life, from birth to death, i.e. 1884-1972, there were tears in my eyes. This is a book about a man dedicated to fighting for his beliefs, but he was a politician at heart. Keep in mind that I tend to instinctively distrust politicians. It is rather remarkable that I\u003cb\u003e \u003cu\u003eso\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/b\u003e loved this book. I will try to never again shy away from a book about politicians……well, at least such books written by John McCullough.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eWhy did I love this book? You learn about American life and values as they were when America was still a land of pioneers to what it had become by the middle of the 20th Century. What the political parties stood for has changed dramatically with time. On completion of this book you have a thorough understanding of the American party system. You travel from an agrarian Midwest value mindset through WW1, the Depression, the New Deal, WW2, the emergence of atomic weapons, the birth of the UN and NATO, the Berlin blockade and successful airlift, the Cold War and McCarthyism, the focus on civil rights, the Korean War all the way up to Kennedy’s presidency. You follow this time-period through the life of a man living through its events, and a man who as president shaped many of these events. McCullough gives you a thorough understanding of all these events and a thorough understanding of the man Truman. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eIt is an honest book that never shies away from the mistakes made. I wasn’t thrilled with Truman’s friendship and dependence upon Pendergast. I felt that Truman’s relationship with his wife was at first not adequately clarified. By the end I understood Truman, all of him. I believe I comprehend both his familial relationships and the value he put on friendships, which explain his relationship with Pendergast . You see both the good and the bad. I very much admire the strength and forthrightness of Truman who was at heart a marvelous politician. Yes, definitely a politician who fought for his party and made mistakes, but dam he tried his best. Always. He never shirked his responsibilities. He never ran away from a problem, but faced them head on. He was not infallible. I still don’t understand why they never had more children……\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eI was born in 1951. I understand now what my parents lived through and why they were who they were. I understand now what lead up to the world I was born into.

Truly a man of the people, who never let the highest office in the country go to his head, Truman made difficult decisions that would have crippled other men within the first four months of his presidency. While not all of his policies were popular during his time, most have been shown to be the right course of action in hindsight. His decision to use the atomic bomb to end World War II lay heavily on conscience, and because of that he was reluctant to ever use it again. Because of this, even with public outcry growing, he refused to use the atomic bomb or the newly developed H-bomb in Korea. Truman was a man of his principles, who put the good of the nation and the people who lived in it before the good of his own public image.

David McCullough describes well the political events surrounding the era and his climb to power – which was gradual but well earned. Truman was only two years younger than Roosevelt but in far better health. He was a vastly different person more prone to indiscretions. Even so he survived well in a turbulent era - the end of World War II, taking the decision to drop the atomic bomb on Japan, the commencement of the Cold War, the creation of the state of Israel (where he did waffle) and the Korean War. Truman importantly promoted the U.N.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eHe was not afraid to take decisions, but he could be petulant as in writing to the Washington Post when they dared to criticize his daughter’s musical performance at a concert (this was something Roosevelt would never have done).\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eI felt the author devoted too many pages to the 1948 campaign (over 60 pages). Very little was said about Truman’s efforts to desegregate the armed forces (how much opposition did this receive?) Also I am somewhat perplexed about Truman’s marriage to his wife Bess. He did marry quite late – at 35 – which is unusual in that era. Bess did not spend that much time with him in Washington during his Senate and Presidential years when he could have used the emotional support. Also they resided in her mother’s house when in Independence, Missouri. For a strong-willed individual Harry Truman seemed to be dominated by both his wife and mother-in-law.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eHis firing of Douglas MacArthur is well depicted as well as his increasing frustration with Joe McCarthy – where it could be said that it was beneath presidential dignity to deal with such a scoundrel.

His growing irritation with his successor Eisenhower is interesting.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eA portrait of a warm and up-front person emerges – plus that of someone who could quickly grasp new situations and evaluate new personalities (with the exception of Josef Stalin – but he was not alone in this).
