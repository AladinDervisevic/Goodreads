the 1520s is a heartbeat from disaster. If the king dies without a male heir, the country could be destroyed by civil war. Henry VIII wants to annul his marriage of twenty years and marry Anne Boleyn. The pope and most of Europe opposes him. Into this impasse steps Thomas Cromwell: a wholly original man, a charmer and a bully, both idealist and opportunist, astute in reading people, and implacable in his ambition. But Henry is volatile: one day tender, one day murderous. Cromwell helps him break the opposition, but what will be the price of his triumph?</span></div></div></div></div><div data-testid="genresList" class="BookPageMetadataSection__genres"><ul class="CollapsableList" aria-label="Top genres for this book"><span class="BookPageMetadataSection__genre"><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/genres/historical-fiction" class="Button Button--tag-inline Button--medium"><span class="Button__labelItem">Historical Fiction</span></a></span> <span class="BookPageMetadataSection__genre"><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/genres/fiction" class="Button Button--tag-inline Button--medium"><span class="Button__labelItem">Fiction</span></a></span> <span class="BookPageMetadataSection__genre"><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/genres/historical" class="Button Button--tag-inline Button--medium"><span class="Button__labelItem">Historical</span></a></span> <span class="BookPageMetadataSection__genre"><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/genres/british-literature" class="Button Button--tag-inline Button--medium"><span class="Button__labelItem">British Literature</span></a></span> <div class="Button__container"><button type="button" class="Button Button--tag-inline Button--medium" aria-label="Show all items in the list"><span class="Button__labelItem">...more</span></button></div></ul></div><div class="BookDetails"><div class="CollapsableList"><span class="Text Text__body3"><div class="FeaturedDetails"><p data-testid="pagesFormat">653 pages, Paperback</p><p data-testid="publicationInfo">First published April 30, 2009</p><p data-testid="awards"><span class="CollapsableList"><span data-testid="award"><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/award/show/13-booker-prize">Booker Prize</a><span class="Text Text__subdued"> (2009)</span></span>, <span data-testid="award"><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/award/show/90-orange-prize">Orange Prize</a> Nominee<!-- -->, Fiction Shortlist<span class="Text Text__subdued"> (2010)</span></span>, <span data-testid="award"><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/award/show/94-james-tait-black-memorial-prize">James Tait Black Memorial Prize</a> Nominee<!-- -->, Fiction<span class="Text Text__subdued"> (2009)</span></span> <div class="Button__container"><button type="button" class="Button Button--inline Button--small" aria-label="Show all items in the list"><span class="Button__labelItem">...more</span></button></div></span></p></div></span> <div class="Button__container"><button type="button" class="Button Button--inline Button--small" aria-label="Show more book details"><span class="Button__labelItem">More details</span></button></div></div></div><hr class="Divider" role="presentation"/><div class="AuthorPreview"><div class="AuthorPreview__profile"><div class="AuthorPreview__avatar"><a class="Avatar Avatar--large" href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/58851.Hilary_Mantel" as="div"><img data-testid="image" class="Avatar__image" alt="Hilary Mantel" src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/authors/1582036110i/58851._UX200_CR0,50,200,200_.jpg"/></a></div><div class="AuthorPreview__info"><h3 class="Text H3"><a class="ContributorLink" href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/58851.Hilary_Mantel"><span class="ContributorLink__name" data-testid="name">Hilary Mantel</span><span class="ContributorLink__badge ContributorLink__badge--medium"><i class="Icon BadgeIcon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 20 20" aria-label="Goodreads Author"><path d="M9.85,5.47C8,5.47,7.08,6.91,7.08,8.58s.93,3,2.66,3a2.78,2.78,0,0,0,2.81-3A2.81,2.81,0,0,0,9.85,5.47Z"></path><path d="M20,10,18.35,8.05,19,5.55l-2.32-1L16.23,2l-2.51.11L12.23,0,10,1.22,7.77,0,6.29,2.09,3.77,2,3.31,4.52,1,5.55l.66,2.5L0,10,1.65,12,1,14.45l2.32,1L3.77,18l2.52-.11L7.77,20,10,18.78,12.23,20l1.49-2.09,2.51.11.46-2.55,2.32-1L18.35,12Zm-7.16,2c0,1.88-1.1,2.77-2.95,2.77-1.43,0-2.66-.63-2.7-2.18h.27c.06,1.37,1.13,1.91,2.42,1.91,1.71,0,2.69-.79,2.69-2.5V10h0a2.79,2.79,0,0,1-2.79,1.94c-2,0-2.95-1.53-2.95-3.31s1-3.38,3.05-3.38a2.7,2.7,0,0,1,2.69,2h0V5.36h.27Z"></path></svg></i></span></a></h3><div class="AuthorPreview__meta"><span class="Text Text__body3 Text__subdued">47<!-- --> <!-- -->books<span class="u-dot-before">6,169<!-- --> <!-- -->followers</span></span></div></div></div><div class="TruncatedText"><div class="TruncatedText__text TruncatedText__text--3" data-testid="contentContainer"><div><span class="Formatted">Hilary Mantel is the bestselling author of many novels including <i> Wolf Hall, </i>which won the Man Booker Prize and the National Book Critics Circle Award for fiction. <i> Bring Up the Bodies,</i> Book Two of the Wolf Hall Trilogy, was also awarded the Man Booker Prize and the Costa Book Award.

class="TruncatedText"><div class="TruncatedText__text TruncatedText__text--5" data-testid="contentContainer"><div><span class="Formatted">I just started Wolf Hall, and I find the relentless use of "he" to be extremely irritating. In the first several chapters, there are dozens of instances where it is not clear who is speaking. Every once in a while, as if recognizing the problem she has created, Mantel uses the phrase "he, Cromwell." Why not just say Cromwell?<br /><br />Unless there is some good reason which I can't imagine, this sort of obfuscation is just lazy writing which disrespects the reader. May I re-think that, based on a comment by another reader. It's not lazy writing. It's very purposeful. And very distracting.<br /><br />... later ... <br /><br />I just read some of the amazon reviews. There are actually quite a few readers who found the "he" business as disconcerting as I did, and who expressed their displeasure in rather strong terms, along with many *-star ratings. However, many others really liked the book, as do many Goodreads readers, so it must not bother them as it does me. <br /><br />Another Goodreads reader suggested that the use of "he" all the time created a closer intimacy with Cromwell. Perhaps, but I see it differently. If you want to create intimacy, use the first person. Then it is clear that everything is seen and felt by the single protagonist, and the reader can share that character's viewpoint, thoughts and feelings. What Mantel has done is not to bring us close to Cromwell, but to inject herself, the author, between the reader and the prime character. She does this on practically every page and I find it jarring every time it happens.<br /><br />Before my final negative notes, let me say that Mantel clearly has an exquisite command of the language. Even in the few chapters I read, her elegant choice of words often made me reflect and smile. She can paint a picture when describing a character or a setting that is truly wonderful. And, when she chooses to do so, she writes a vivid scene that has power and emotion.<br /><br />Such continuity of story, however, is the exception rather than the rule. The constant switching of time and place, often without the merest hint of transition, made the reading much more difficult than it had to be. Just a word here or there would have made a huge difference.<br /><br />Finally, the breezy style in which much of the book is written is entertaining, as many have noted and I agree, but it had the effect of making me wonder if Mantel was as true to the history as I think a historical fiction should be. Of course the dialogue and many of the personal incidents are made up, but does the author, when portraying actual events, present them accurately? I think such concern for the truth is an obligation of an author when writing about historical characters and events. Mantel left me unsure.<br /><br />I think I've had enough of Wolf Hall, and perhaps other Goodreads readers have had enough of my criticism of what is surely a popular book. I don't usually write negative opinions, but this book just seemed to drag them out of me. I hope I have not offended anyone.</span></div></div></div></section></section><section class="ReviewCard__tags"><ul class="CollapsableList"><a

class="Formatted">Have you ever been with a group of people when someone tells a joke and the rest of the group thinks it's hilarious but you just don't get it? <i>Wolf Hall</i> was that way for me. So many people think it's brilliant while I couldn't maintain enough interest to finish it.<br /><br />I love historical fiction, especially from this time period, so I expected to really like this one. I thought that telling the story of Henry VIII from the viewpoint of Cromwell was an interesting twist and I looked forward to learning more about him. So what was the problem?<br /><br />Well, for starters, the writing style took turns irritating and confusing me. Quotation marks are apparently optional, making it hard to figure out that you're reading dialogue until you get to the "he said". Speaking of which, the author relies heavily on the pronoun "he" and since there were frequently at least 2 men in each scene, this reader was often unsure which he was the right he. As the men in scene multiplied, so did the confusion. It took so much effort to figure out who was who and who said what and what was going on that it stopped being entertaining or thought-provoking and just became work.<br /><br />And did I mention the colon? The poor, lonesome, and oft-ignored colon finally has his time in the spotlight in this novel. Upgraded from lonely punctuation understudy, the colon has a lead role here. The author uses colons so frequently and somewhat oddly that I would recommend a complete colonectomy. Here's an example from one paragraph: (Aargh! A colon! It must be contagious.)<br /><br />"But by the time he reaches Dover the big gash on his scalp has closed, and the tender parts inside, he trusts, have mended themselves: kidneys, lungs, and heart." "Morgan Williams will have done an inventory of him before he left: teeth (miraculously) still in his head, and two eyes, miraculously seeing. Two arms, two legs: what more do you want?"<br /><br />Overall, the book felt like it was trying too hard to be literary. Some of the prose was lovely, but there were enough little stylistic choices that annoyed me to put me off. After reading numerous reviews, even from people who loved the book, that said that most of the characters remained distant throughout and that they didn't learn anything more about Cromwell after reading 500+ pages, that was enough for me. Sadly, life's too short and my TBR pile's too big. I had to abandon this one.</span></div></div></div></section></section><section class="ReviewCard__tags"><ul class="CollapsableList"><a

class="ReviewText"><section class="ReviewText__content"><div class="TruncatedText"><div class="TruncatedText__text TruncatedText__text--5" data-testid="contentContainer"><div><span class="Formatted">The thing to remember when starting this book is that 99% percent of the time the pronoun 'he' refers to Cromwell, even at times when the sentence structure makes it seems like 'he' would be someone else. It took me a short while to realize this, but once I did, I was fine. You are in Cromwell's head; you see everything from his perspective. As he reacts to others' reactions of him (many times, he is bemused to see how he is thought of) another layer of characterization is added.<br /><br />This novel is beautifully written with unique descriptions (I love when authors can pull that uniqueness off -- not easy to do!) sprinkled here and there; Cromwell is fascinating (and drawn sympathetically by Mantel) and even surprisingly charming in his interactions with family members and certain others. (Though that's not to say that he doesn't use some of these others either.) And he's funny! Though all of this is done, oh, so, subtly.<br /><br />It's said that historical fiction is as much about the time during which it's written as it is about the time it's set in. And through Mantel's eyes, we see the similarities of the time periods' political intrigue, as messy and incestuous then as it is now. I thought I was done with Tudor historical fiction (I've read so much of it through the years) but this book is different.<br /><br />You won't understand the novel's title until later in the book, and I won't explain it here, as I got excited (a rare emotion when reading) seeing the meanings unfold, and I wouldn't want to spoil that for anyone. <br /><br />I also got very excited as I read this quote from page 394:<br /><blockquote>Suppose within each book there is another book, and within every letter on every page another volume constantly unfolding; but these volumes take no space on the desk. Suppose knowledge could be reduced to a quintessence, held within a picture, a sign, held within a place which is no place. Suppose the human skull were to become capacious, spaces opening inside it, humming chambers like beehives.</blockquote><br />I felt as if I had found the 'key' to the whole book. <br /><br />This is one of those long novels that I loved living with and hated to see end, one of those experiences which causes you not to want to rush off to read something else, because you're still soaking in the one you've just finished.</span></div></div></div></section></section><section class="ReviewCard__tags"><ul class="CollapsableList"></ul></section><footer class="SocialFooter"><div data-testid="stats"

</a><br><b>Thomas Cromwell by Hans Holbein. Cromwell was a great supporter of Holbein and personal gave him many commissions for paintings, but also recommended him to the powerful people he knew.</b><br><br>Thomas Cromwell was first and foremost a thinker. The myth that we only use about 10% of our brains has been debunked in recent years, but I do think we can accurately say that for some of us our brain works more efficiently. I think if we were to sit in a very quiet room with Thomas Cromwell we might actually be able to hear the humming of his mind like the circuitry of a super computer. Henry the Eighth <br><br><b>
  <blockquote>I'm 'Enery the Eighth, I am,<br>'Enery the Eighth I am, I am!<br>I got married to the widow next door,<br>She's been married seven times before<br>And every one was an 'Enery<br>She wouldn't have a Willie nor a Sam<br>I'm her eighth old man named 'Enery<br>'Enery the Eighth, I am!</blockquote>
</b><br><br>Sorry I can’t ever seem to say or write his name without that song popping into my head. Let’s try this again. <br><br>Henry the Eighth was not supposed to be king. The 16th century was supposed to be the return of the Age of Camelot when his older brother, Arthur, claimed his birthright and became king of England. It was Arthur that had been tutored and trained to be king. Henry would have been destined for the church if not for the fickleness of fate that left his brother dead six months before his sixteenth birthday. Henry the Eighth rules like a second son that was always second best. He is impetuous, bombastic, corpulent, and prone to fits of fury. He is not a stupid man and always surrounded himself with intelligent men, disciplined men, who could provide him with wise counsel. He did not always take their advice, but he did always give them a chance to make a case. <br><br><a href="https://s1183.photobucket.com/user/jkeeten/media/Henry_VIII_Belvoir_Castle_zpsc80c4f03.jpg.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">

</a><br><b>The most iconic image of Henry the Eighth painted by Holbein as a mural in Whitehall Palace. It was unfortunately destroyed by fire in 1698, but survives through the numerous copies that were made of it. Notice the bulging calves. Henry was always very proud of them.</b><br><br><br>Henry preferred advisers named Thomas.<br><br>Thomas Wolsey<br>Thomas More<br>Thomas Cromwell<br><br>Cromwell worked for Thomas Wolsey and when the cardinal fell out of favor it could have been the end for Cromwell’s hopes as well. Cromwell is a lot of things, a complicated man, a sometimes hard man, but ultimately he is a survivor. It is so interesting that Hilary Mantel decided to paint a more sympathetic picture of him than what I’d previously thought him to be. He understood money and that true power does not reside with the man on the throne. <br><br><i>”The world is not run from where he thinks. Not from his border fortresses, not even from Whitehall. The world is run from Antwerp, from Florence, from places he has never imagined; from Lisbon, from where the ships with sails of silk drift west and are burned up in the sun. Not from castle walls, but from countinghouses, not by the call of the bugle but by the click of abacus, not by the grate and click of the mechanism of the gun but by the scrape of the pen on the page of the promissory note that pays for the gun and the gunsmith and the powder and shot.”</i> <br><br><a href="https://s1183.photobucket.com/user/jkeeten/media/ThomasMore_zps1e8368c9.jpg.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">

</a><br><b>Thomas More by Hans Holbein.</b><br><br>I first met Thomas More through his book Utopia in a class in college. The Praise of Folly by Erasmus was also required reading for the same class. I thought both books were fantastic because to truly understand the writings of these two important writers one must explore the history behind the books. So I wanted to love More, but as I learned more about him the title of his book became more and more an inappropriate extension of the man. His view of how the real world should work was not the Utopia he persuaded me could exist. He was opposed to the Protestant Reformation. He, with great fervor, began to hunt down anyone connected to the Reformation and interrogate, torture and burn them. He didn’t keep his distance from it. He was frequently down in the stench and the squalor of the dungeons watching his prisoners being broken on the rack. The flames of burning heretics danced in his eyes. He may have taken too much pleasure in his work. <br><br>My theory is anyone who wears a hairshirt all the time and scourges themselves for evening entertainment is not someone I want making decisions about my life. More may have been brilliant, but those beautiful marbles in his head were scrambled. <br><br><a href="https://s1183.photobucket.com/user/jkeeten/media/AnneBoleyn_zps8bf6166a.jpg.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">

</a><br><b>There have been many beautiful actresses to play the enchanting Anne Boleyn, but my favorite is Natalie Dormer from The Tudors simply because she has that saucy smirk that could be used as such a weapon quite capable of bringing down a King or a kingdom to achieve her ambitions.</b><br><br>When the King, in his pursuit of Anne Boleyn, decides that the only way he is going to free himself from the albatross from Aragon, Catherine, is to break with the Roman Catholic Church. This puts the King in direct conflict with one of his most trusted advisers the before mentioned Thomas More. Sir Thomas cannot break with his beliefs. When he is asked to sign an oath supporting the King he refuses. He certainly had a martyr complex. In fact Cromwell in a last ditch effort to try and save More’s life points out his hubris in thinking of himself as a Christ figure. It was to no avail. <br><br>I do believe that Cromwell feels an uneasiness about the fates of the powerful men who came before him. He is always trying to hedge his bets, loaning money at ridiculous low interests to the aristocrats, soothing the relationship between Anne and her sister Mary (Henry’s current favorite bed warmer as he waits for Anne to pop open her corset.), taking care of embarrassing circumstances for other people, forming alliances with the enemies of his friends, and being kind to Henry’s only surviving child (Mary) with Catherine. He is always trying to anticipate the future. He worked to soften the blows to his enemies believing that someday they would be potential allies. He took in orphans, not just from his family, but even from people unconnected to him. He assessed their best aspects and put them with tutors so they would be useful to him in the future. He understands people and knows how to manipulate them and encourage them at the same time. <br><br><i>“But it is no use to justify yourself. It is no good to explain. It is weak to be anecdotal. It is wise to conceal the past even if there is nothing to conceal. A man's power is in the half-light, in the half-seen movements of his hand and the unguessed-at expression of his face. It is the absence of facts that frightens people: the gap you open, into which they pour their fears, fantasies, desires.”</i><br><br>He is but a man and there is no time when that is more evident than when his daughter Grace dies. <br><br><i>”Grace dies in his arms; she dies easily, as naturally as she was born. He eases her back against the damp sheet: a child of impossible perfection, her fingers uncurling like thin white leaves. I never knew her, he thinks; I never knew I had her. It has always seemed impossible to him that some act of his gave her life, some unthinking thing that he and Liz did, on some unmemorable night.”</i><br><br>The sweating sickness took his wife and both his daughters leaving only him and his son Gregory alive. Maybe those deaths is why he felt so compelled to fill his house with children. It didn’t have to be his children. He thought all children were salvageable, moldable, if encouraged to work at being better at what they were best at. <br><br>Cromwell grew up the son of a blacksmith. His father beat him so severely, in fact the book opens with a scene that showed the impassioned brutality that his father was capable of, that Cromwell leaves to join the army and seek his fortune abroad. He taught himself to read. He was always working his mind like a muscle making it stronger with every book he read. With every moment he spent studying the workings of economics, politics, and psychology (he didn’t know that was what it was called.) he was giving himself the means to make better decisions, to offer better advice, to hone his cunning. <br><br>He was truly a self made man who by sheer audacity and brilliance made it to the pinnacles of power. When he becomes sick though and is at his most vulnerable the fears of a child creep into his mind. <br><br><i>”On the stairs he can hear the efficient, deathly clip of his father’s steel-tipped boots.”</i><br><br><a href="https://s1183.photobucket.com/user/jkeeten/media/Hilary-Mantel_zps3c13b602.jpg.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">

</a><br><b>Hilary Mantel, what big eyes you have.</b><br><br>Little is known about the early life of Thomas Cromwell. He would be pleased to know that. He was much more interested in knowing everything about everyone and careful about letting others know anything about him. He was a long game thinker. Something he does one day may not make sense to those around him until much later when the dominoes fall a new direction. Mantel will clothe him, put flesh on his bones, share his innermost thoughts, and show you a man capable of being ruthless, but just as likely to be compassionate. Though Henry was particularly fascinated with lopping off heads Cromwell knew that ultimately as you eliminate one enemy you only create more. If possible it is much smarter to blackmail, confuse, or convince an arch enemy, maybe not to be friends that would be expecting too much, but at least to become a passive challenger. <br><br>There are a lot of Thomas’s in this book and at times it can seem confusing, but the rule of thumb is if you are not clear about who is speaking or who is sharing their inner thoughts that would be Thomas Cromwell. <br><br>Winner of the Man Booker Prize in 2009 and highly recommended by this dedicated reader. <br><br>If you wish to see more of my most recent book and movie reviews, visit <a

true in fairy tales<br>Meant for someone else but not for me<br>Mmm, historical novelists were out to get me<br>That's the way it seemed<br>Disappointment haunted all my dreams<br><i>Then I read Wolf Hall ! Now I'm a believer!<br>Not a trace of doubt in my mind!<br>Ooh I'm in love!<br>Ooh Hilary Mantel I couldn’t leave you if I tried</i><br><br><img src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1380379819i/736323._SY540_.jpg" class="gr-hostedUserImg" loading="lazy"><br><br><br>But then some strange things began to percolate through to my sluggish oily consciousness, beetling my brows and causing pushed out bottom lip expressions to become prominent. The style is great, all that detail, every surface covered, you never see the props manager or the mike boom, the brocades and all the grey velvet actually seem <i>real</i> (what budget did this novel get?) but.<br><br>But.<br><br>I noticed that although we crawl along with Thomas Cromwell inch by inch, hour by hour, Hilary Mantel never, never, never mentions how her hero <i>actually feels </i>about anything, never mentions his thoughts, his worries, his concerns, his interior. It’s all surface. What he said, his gestures, the way he looked, what he knew, what he ate, how he knew how to cook it, who he yelled at, who he was kind to (children and animals, aah)- this is what we get ; what he thought he was up to or could or couldn’t achieve, his fears, who he hated, all that, has to be inferred; this is the poster novel for show don’t tell; this shows everything, almost, and tells nothing.<br><br>That that is a deliberately chosen technique is clear; and you must appreciate if you cannot celebrate or accept if you cannot appreciate. But if you can’t get on board with it this novel is going to drive you into the arms of a therapist.<br><br><b>AT THE THERAPIST’S</b><br><br>Dr Rayner : So what’s been happening this week?<br>Reader of Wolf Hall : Well, it’s er er Thomas.<br>Dr Rayner (professionally covering up his increasing irritation) : Ah, Thomas. Again.<br>ROWH : He… he just never tells me anything. I have to guess, all the time. <br>Dr Rayner : Ah ha, um. Yes…<br>ROWH : I feel so close to him, and yet…<br>Dr Rayner : And yet so distant.<br>ROWH : Ah, you know, you know!<br>Dr Rayner’s eyes dart about, as if seeking a sympathetic face. But there is none.<br><br><br>There’s more. There’s a brilliant JG Ballard short story called <i>The Garden of Time</i>. A guy potters around in his beautiful garden and in the mid-distance he can see an enormous hostile army approaching across the landscape. It seems to be in slow motion. Every day it’s a little nearer. Neither he nor his wife has any thoughts of moving away. They look after the exquisite flowers, they repot plants, they discuss borders. It’s a great metaphor. Wolf Hall is in slow motion. There’s the painfully attenuated downfall of Cardinal Wolsey. Then there’s the even more excruciatingly drawn out overarching issue of the Great Matter of the King’s Divorce, or Annulment, whatever. Off with the Katherine and on with the Anne. <br>So here’s a funny thing. After the great Cardinal Wolsey (and he is a great character, I loved him) - after he’s dead and gone, (none of this is plot spoiler, this is history! – it’s quite a trick to write a long story which everyone knows and still have them queuing round the block) I was scratching my head and thinking that although I’d been hearing so much of and about Cardinal Wolsey (he is the Penn to Thomas Cromwell’s Teller) in the months days hours minutes seconds of his huge demise I still couldn’t figure out exactly why - why - why King Henry turned on him in such fury. A quick Wikipedia gave me this: <br><br><br><i>Wolsey had failed [to get the King’s marriage annulled] and was dismissed from public office in 1529. Wolsey then began a secret plot to have Anne Boleyn forced into exile and began communicating with the Pope to that end. When this was discovered, Henry ordered Wolsey's arrest</i><br><br>Whoah. Unless I fell asleep during the crucial bit, that is not in the book. Don’t you think it should be? Might help explain things a bit better? How strange of Hilary.<br><br>So if Hilary Mantel wrote a novel about the Kennedy assassination you would have got lots of detailed scenes of life at the court of the Kennedys, the domestic problems of the Oswalds, their life in Russia, what the crowds were saying on the Dealey Plaza, but when the motorcade appeared she would cut immediately to the autopsy and the comments of the surgeons and their family situations. We would get a few scenes with Jack Ruby and his pals, but next thing you know he’d be under arrest. Huh, what happened?<br><br>It’s like being on the inside, but <i>the outside of the inside.</i><br><br>What are we taught about drama? Exposition, complication, resolution (comedy); exposition, conflict, catastrophe (tragedy). What does Hilary do? Throws the rules away. Hilary, and this goes double for A Place of Greater Safety, her vast novel about the French Revolution, goes for : exposition, complication, more exposition, more and more exposition, more complication. Where’s the conflict? Off stage. Is this a problem? It is going to be, for some people. Quentin Tarantino fans, players of Thrill Kill and Mortal Kombat, you know, impatient types.<br><br><b>NOT ZOMBIES OR PUPPETS</b><br> <br>But historical novelists, especially those like Hilary who embroider their worlds so lavishly, and set the right birds in each tree at the right angle, and the weeds underfoot, and the stench of the straw in the barn, and the wounds of a knife fight as well as each bauble, buckle, bead, biggins and bodice I think do us a grand service, re-plugging us back into the people who we were, making it possible to think that life did indeed go on in almost recognisable forms 500 years ago. It’s like claiming these lives back, scraping off the encrustings of ignorance and they don’t look like zombies or puppets. <br><br>Some literature fans tend to get their sneery faces on and call historical fiction middlebrow. They do! Although I know what they mean, there are brows (brows = class), there are three main classes and they each have a brow, it’s straightforward enough. What are Darconville’s Cat, Wittgenstein’s Mistress, The Pale King, Invisible Cities, Ulysses, Mrs Dalloway and Life : A User’s Guide? Highbrow – a clue is in the fact that none of them can tell a story worth a damn but the things they do with language constitute a legal high. So then, lowbrow must be the mindless genre churn you get in the lovely world of – er - Romance, for instance – they have titles like Come Away with Me, This Man, Dark Soul, Beautiful Disaster. Probably that sounds insulting to Romance fans but hey, come on, you know this stuff is popcorn and not haute cuisine, right? You ain’t kidding yourselves are you? And there’s all kinds of interesting authors who rescued formerly lowbrow genres and made them into middlebrow literature – Hammett and Chandler for detective stories, McMurtry for Westerns, Ballard and a zillion others for science fiction (which was originally considered to be as wretched as the other low genres)… but I am wandering from the subject which is – everything that’s not high or low is in the middle ( that’s in the Bible, Habbakuk 10:4). Therefore Hilary Mantel is middlebrow.<br><br>Okay, so what, we can’t dine on foi gras all the livelong day, but if this is middle it’s somewhere near the top of the middle bangin’ on the ceiling, and eventually, who cares about these distinctions.<br><br><br><b>The Great Matter of the King’s Divorce - a historical note</b><br><br>Yeah, you can think that this was some egotistical tyrannical English king thinking with his royal member and stamping on the floor until he got what he wanted even if that meant excommunication and the sundering of the Church, but actually - he wanted an heir – a son – because of the succession, because if the succession wasn’t clear and undisputed, there would be a certain return of the fratricidal civil war which had gone on for 50 years prior to Henry’s father’s victory – so it wasn’t, in fact, a trivial matter.<br><br><b>Two great quotes</b><br><br>Cromwell is faced with a recalcitrant noble who’s making a terrible fuss about his ancient rights and privileges. <br><br><i>How can he explain it to him? The world isn’t run from where he thinks. Not from his border fortresses, not even from Whitehall. The world is run from Antwerp, from Florence, from places he has never imagined; from Lisbon, from where the ships with sails of silk drift west and are burned up in the sun. Not from castle walls but from counting houses, not by the call of the bugle but by the click of the abacus, not by the grate and click of the mechanism of the gun but by the scrape of the pen on the page of the promissory note that pays for the gun and the gunsmith and the powder and shot.</i><br><br>and<br><br><i><br><br>When have I ever forced anyone to do anything, he starts to say : but Richard cuts in, ‘No you don’t, I agree, it’s just that you are practised at persuading, and sometimes it’s quite difficult, sir, to distinguish being persuaded by you from being knocked down in the street and stamped on.’</i><br><br><br>This novel took me so many hours to read but you know I don’t want them back, Hilary Mantel can keep them.

  <b>The fate of peoples is made like this, two men in small rooms. Forget the coronations, the conclaves of cardinals, the pomp and processions. This is how the world changes: a counter pushed across a table, a pen stroke that alters the force of a phrase, a woman’s sigh as she passes and leaves on the air a trail of orange flower or rose water; her hand pulling close the bed curtain, the discrete sigh of flesh against flesh.</b>
</blockquote>Uneasy lies the head that wears the crown…but really, crown-wearers seem to have little difficulty with fabrication. Do they mean lie, as in lying down? I mean I would take it off before going to bed. It might get pretty uncomfortable trying to sleep with that thing still on. Wouldn’t it be more accurate to say uneasy “sits the head that wears the crown,” although that creates in my tiny mind an image of Mister Potato head, with legs and feet. You know you want to see that, so go ahead. I’ll wait. <input type="checkbox" class="spoiler__control" aria-label="The following text has been marked spoiler.

Already married, but wifey does not pop out a male heir? What’s a king to do? Why, twist, turn, beg, borrow, steal, threaten, intimidate, and murder until you get your way. Spoiled children with their own states are fond of such behavior. Of course, to a large extent, one must engage in these forms of feces flinging and head-lopping at one remove, as kings are too proud to be seen with their hands so filled, whether with their own droppings or axe handles. Thus the presence of people like Thomas Cromwell. Thank you, your majesty, I’ll take that now. <br><br>Since the Catholic Church was all that stood in the way of Henry VIII getting what he wanted, H8 sought to remove it. Seizing the church’s real estate and other holdings would be a nice bonus. Selling off the stolen bits would help pay for the ever-popular urge to go to war with France. And setting up his non-ecclesiastical self as the head of his own sort-of Catholic Church, the Anglican Church, meant that, in addition to visiting horrors on the RC he would be claiming even more divine rights. And this lunatic convinces himself that God wanted this. A bit self-serving, no? Sheesh!<br><br><img src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1428078801i/14360322._SY540_.jpg" width="190" height="xxx" alt="description" class="gr-hostedUserImg" loading="lazy"><img src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1428078684i/14360294._SY540_.jpg" width="198" height="xxx" alt="description" class="gr-hostedUserImg" loading="lazy"><br><b>H8 by Holbein</b> - from Wikimedia -- and <b>Damian Lewis</b> - BBC<br><br>So, you would expect that in Hilary Mantel’s rollicking tale of Tudor England, Cromwell would be painted in rather dark shades. The author offers something other. Hogwarts DA Masters notwithstanding, the darkest of the dark arts is the power of manipulation. The proper words tossed near the proper ear can wreak devastation no less awful than an armored division. Cromwell is portrayed as a practitioner of 16th century RealPolitik, someone who uses his rapier wit, his power, his capacity for manipulation, his wide knowledge of the world, and his deep intelligence to serve his king. Is he in it mostly for himself? Maybe. Probably, but he is shown in small bites, talking to this one, planting spies, chatting with that one, nuancing everyone within reach to see things his way, the king’s way, and he sees that more direct action is taken when words alone will not do. <br><br>Cromwell, both the real one and his fictitious doppelganger, is a pretty interesting guy, rising from modest (and, if Mantel does not mislead, abusive) origins, dashing off to soldier for hire, becoming expert in international trade of various sorts, making very useful friends and connections along the way, becoming a lawyer, and with his contact list and rep for discretion, rising as far as a low-born can rise in Tudor England. I am sure that, had he shown an inclination towards the culinary arts, he might have been considered a Man for All Seasonings. (sorry)<br><br>He is our window on the Tudor era. Regardless of the accuracy of the portrayal, as a literary device, Cromwell is ideally placed to allow us a look into many of the machinations of the era. Questionable prophetess, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Barton" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"> Holy Maid of London</a>, making life uncomfortable for a wandering king? Cromwell is there. Both to hear her speak and see her burned. Anne Boleyn plotting to get around the Church’s refusal to annul H8’s marriage? Yep, TC is right in the middle. The population being laid waste by a plague sweating disease? He loses family. Cromwell was a real-life <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zelig" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Zelig</a> of the era, with a hand in every historical pie. <br><br>What motivates Thomas Cromwell? He moves through the novel like an avatar of the author, a witness to the things the author wants us so know, but lacking much of a personality himself. The delightfully acerbic wit he manifests is hardly unique to him in this telling. One might point to his ambition, and there are certain decisions he makes or directions he takes that offer some guidance, but I never really got much of a feel for what really makes Thomas tick. Is Thomas Cromwell Horatio Alger, an exemplar of hard work, smarts and ambition paying off in the end? Is he a model for the notion that power corrupts? Does he really have morals, or merely goals? Is he a <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/bbc/11361080/Thomas-Cromwell-was-the-Islamic-State-of-his-day.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">religious extremist</a> or a technocrat? In a recent theatrical production, the writers took this problem in hand and decided to anchor their production on Cromwell’s quest for vengeance on all those who had seen to the toppling of his mentor and father figure, the larger-than-life Wolsey. (I absolutely see Sidney Greenstreet in my tiny mind as Wolsey) That makes a lot of sense, lending a core of cohesion to a sequence of loose scenes, a lot of this-happens-and-then-that. <br><br><img src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1428083822i/14361581.jpg" width="197" height="xxx" alt="description" class="gr-hostedUserImg" loading="lazy"><img src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1428083822i/14361582._SY540_.png" width="192" height="xxx" alt="description" class="gr-hostedUserImg" loading="lazy"><br><b>Anne Boleyn</b> by unknown and <b>Claire Foy</b> in the role<br><br>Well, Thomas is only one element here, albeit the largest. It is the era that Mantel brings to life. It was a time of big change. H8 may be established in our 21st century minds as a solidly placed monarch, but the security of his line was very much in question, thus the freaking out about producing a male heir. The Protestant Reformation was underway and the world was in flux. Plagues…um…plagued Europe and the enlightenment was far in the future. <br><br>While this look at the Tudor era is gruesome, enlightening and fun, it also shines a light, as good historical fiction does, on contemporary concerns. Torture? Check. Religious extremism? Check. TC is seen by at least one writer as a Tudor version of ISIS. Privacy concerns? Check. Government abuse of authority? Check. The one percent riding roughshod over the rest of us? Check. National wars for private purposes? Check. Issues of separation of church and state? Check. So, for those of you who have not yet taken on this large novel, and it’s younger siblings, one born, the other gestating, keep an eye out for how the Tudor era contains many of the same conflicts we endure today. Of course one might despair by doing this. Really? We have learned nothing in five hundred years? But one might also see some universality in the human condition, across time and space. <br><br>There are many, many characters in <i>Wolf Hall</i>. Mantel has included a nice list of them at the front of the book. I found I needed to refer to it frequently. It can be a bit daunting to keep track of what is going on, or to discern who is talking to whom, particularly when so many of the names are used by multiple characters. Most particularly, there are more Toms here than at a convention of male cats held in a turkey farm, enough Johns to construct a considerable public lavatory, as well as herds of Harries and Henries, Annes, Katherines and Marys, and probably a few more household names that repeat uncomfortably often. You will be needing that chart. That said, realizing that TC is the author’s and thus the readers’ eyes on pretty much everything helps. <br><br>There is a very different take here on Thomas More than the one we are accustomed to. <i>A Man For All Seasons</i> presented More as a moralist, one who stuck by his principles in opposing H8’s desire to be rid of wife #1 in favor of wife #2. In this version we are shown a Thomas More who is much more an Ayatollah than a serene wise man, as much a political player as a man of the cloth. He happily sends to the torturer and the executioner those who oppose his views. Mantel shows a bit of sympathy for H8 trying to dismantle an organization that includes such dark prigs. <br><br><img src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1428082279i/14361207._SY540_.jpg" width="196" height="xxx" alt="description" class="gr-hostedUserImg" loading="lazy"><img src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1428082279i/14361208._SY540_.jpg" width="201" height="xxx" alt="description" class="gr-hostedUserImg" loading="lazy"><br><b>Thomas More</b> by Holbein and <b>Anton Lesser</b> in the role<br><br>The novel does not tie up neatly. There are two more volumes after all, and those who remember their history, or who, like me, are memory-challenged and need to look such things up, know how it ends, anyway. It is the journey through this often dark age that is the treat. The wit alone would have been enough for me. The feel for the time adds depth. <br><br>The novel and it’s younger sib have become the source material for both a BBC miniseries and stage productions in Britain and the USA, and seems to be gathering cultural strength and presence as more branches extend from the Wolf Hall tree. Can the graphic novel and the Barbie Anne Boleyn be far behind? The series from the Beeb has already aired on the east side of the pond, and is scheduled to begin on Easter, April 5, here in the states. <br><br>In short, for a book with a considerable page count, and covering thirty five years of English and European history, the results of most of which we already know, <i>Wolf Hall</i> is an engrossing read, rich with all-world-large personalities, bristling with sharply barbed wit and intelligence, richly appointed with intrigue and betrayal, red with blood, and great fun to read. There are sections that sag a bit, but keep on, there will be another scene just around the bend that will make you smile and sometimes even laugh out loud. And there are passages that will transport you with their beauty and insight.<br><br>BTW, the title, <i>Wolf Hall</i> refers to the residence of the Seymours (the family serving up one of theirs to be counted among the many wives) and is a takeoff on a Latin saying, <i>homo homini lupus est</i>, or ‘man is a wolf to man.’ He is indeed, and what big teeth he has. <br><br><br>Review posted – 4/3/15<br><br>Publication date – 4/30/2009<br><br>The third volume in the series, <i>The Mirror and the Light</i>, is expected to be out by the end of 2019<br><br>=============================<b>EXTRA STUFF</b><br><br>Links to the author’s <a href="http://hilary-mantel.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">personal</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/hilary_mantel" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+HilarymantelAuthor/posts" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Google +</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/HilaryMantelAuthor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">FB</a> pages<br><br>My review of the next book in the Thomas Cromwell series, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1270402625" rel="nofollow noopener">Bring Up the Bodies</a><br><br>A nice article from the Telegraph about the <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/11375601/who-was-thomas-cromwell-facts-trivia-wolf-hall.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"> historical TC </a><br><br><a target="_blank">Another</a><br><br>Fab item by Mantel in the NY Review of Books on <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/blogs/nyrblog/2015/mar/27/how-to-play-wolf-hall/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"> how her characters should be played </a><br><br>Interview with <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/11330705/Mark-Rylance-interview-Wolf-Hall.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Mark Rylance</a>, who plays TC in the BBC production.<blockquote>

win the Booker this year - I just cannot bring myself to spend anymore time with her lifeless narrator.<br /><br />More than anything else Wolf Hall seemed to me to be a literary experiment - on how closely a woman can get into a man's mind, and as far as I am concerned, a qualified failure. I could never truly feel that the narration was being executed by a male voice, it was as if a woman narrator residing inside a captive male character was telling the story and every time a ‘he’ or 'his' comes along, it resulted in a string of confused stumblings over adjectives before I remembered again (many times) that it is of himself that the narrator is talking about. Eventually I came to understand the reason for this jarring feeling - it was not because I was not reading thoroughly enough, it was because I couldn't think of the narrator as a ‘he’ - it just didn't cut it, especially when he/she informed me with wonder of how men embrace other men.<br /><br />I wish Mary Boleyn had been the narrator, she was the only 'real' person in this narrative peopled by artificial characters, only she had an authentic voice to me and I can't help but feel that she was the character that Mantel most identified with - the novel came alive and took such vibrancy every time Mary entered the narrator's field of vision, like a deprived woman lighting up at the sight of a beautiful mirror to finally examine herself!<br /><br />As I said, I am open to the fact that my bad experience was due to a failure of imagination on my part, so I hope fans of this book will take pity on my deprived pleasure and be gentle in their recriminations.<br /><br />Come to think of it I really cannot think of any book I have read in which a novelist tries to get so intimate with the mind of a narrator of the opposite sex. So maybe my problem was not a failure of imagination but a poverty of literary experience as I haven't encountered such an effort before; maybe I need to read some Hardy.<br /><br />I also believe that if there were less 'Thomas's in the story, I could have still come out the better in this expedition. So there.<br /><br /></span></div></div></div></section></section><section class="ReviewCard__tags"><ul class="CollapsableList"><a

class="ReviewText"><section class="ReviewText__content"><div class="TruncatedText"><div class="TruncatedText__text TruncatedText__text--5" data-testid="contentContainer"><div><span class="Formatted">Hilary Mantel sure knows how to write; her prose is eloquent and sophisticated. Stylistically speaking, she is very distinctive. Very few writers wield grammar the way she does; she uses every means of punctuation at her disposal to achieve real effectual writing. At some points her writing is simply beautiful, but there are also some real difficulties associated with it. <br><br>This is a hard novel to read. It chronicles the life of Thomas Cromwell, and the narrative is focalised through him. However, at times it did become incredibly confusing. Mantel uses the third person, and repeatedly uses the pronoun “he.” But, who is the “he” in question? During one long piece of dialogue it became difficult to realise who was speaking. Both the Duke of Norfolk and Thomas were having a pretty in depth discussion about politics and so forth, both were referred to as “he” frequently. This may sound unusual, but if you‘ve read this book you’ll know exactly what I’m talking about. <br><br>This meant that in order to understand this novel, and perhaps even enjoy it, it demands your full attention. This is no light reading. The narrative is rich in depth and complexity. I had a few problems with some passages, so I read them again and got the gist of things. But, I really do think this would put many readers off. This requires an attentive and patient person. Also, a solid grasp on the history is vital. Mantel does not hand you the facts; she tells you Cromwell’s life story, but the rest is up to you. If you can get over these obstacles, as I did, then what develops is a fantastic portrayal of Tudor England, and Thomas Cromwell’s life. Trust me; this book’s worth sticking with. <br><br><b> Cold, cold Cromwell </b><br><br><img src="https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1459260340ra/18588598.gif" width="400" height="200" alt="description" class="gr-hostedUserImg" loading="lazy"><br><br>So, if you’ve made it this far into my review, you’ll want to hear about the positives. Cromwell is an incredibly interesting historical figure, and Mantel’s portrayal of him is superb. She has evoked the essence of a self-made man who gained the ear of the King, through nothing but his own personal merits, which eventually lead to his sovereign’s complete trust. However, Cromwell is also very emotionless. He’s driven with ambition, to fulfil all that he can with his intellect, but he shuts out the rest of his life in the process. He loses a lot of family, but he gets over it very, very quickly. What he experiences would have broken most people. <br><br>By portraying such a thing, Mantel demonstrates Cromwell’s resolve. This gives him the heartlessness to succeed in the backstabbing world of Tudor politics; it gives him the nonchalance to betray and to use people as he climbs the social ladder. But, what goes around comes around, if you know anything about history, you’ll know what fate the wheel has for Cromwell. Cromwell’s relationship with Wolsey is an apt foreshadowing. I’m digressing here, my point is that Cromwell isn’t a very nice man; he isn’t heroic or likable, only resourceful and cold. He had to be to survive and become more than he once was; he had to be to gain the ear of the King, and to point him in the direction of Wolf Hall. <br><br><i>"The trouble with England, he thinks, is that it's so poor in gesture. We shall have to develop a hand signal for ‘Back off, our prince is fucking this man's daughter.’ He is surprised that the Italians have not done it. Though perhaps they have, and he just never caught on." </i><br><br><b>&gt;Final thoughts</b>- This is a great read, but it does require a great deal of focus. I love Mantel’s style of writing, and having already read the second book, I know the problems are worked out of it a bit. But, for this book, my enjoyment was hindered by having to re-read certain passages where the writing was at its extremist. The wonder of this work resides in its historical detail, its characterisation and its creative way of making the mundane details of life seem marvellous.<br><br>__________________________________<br><br>You can connect with me on social media via <a href="https://linktr.ee/sean.ultra_vegan1" rel="nofollow noopener">My

class="Formatted">Do you ever wonder about why people choose to read the books they do? Well, I can tell you, I read Wolf Hall by Hilary Mantel because it won the Book Prize For Fiction in 2009. You see, The Children's Book by A.S. Byatt was nominated for the Booker in 2009, but did not win. Curious to see what book could beat one of my favorite books of all time, I looked up Wolf Hall. And what do you know, it's another piece of historical fiction set in England and written by a woman. This could be interesting! I was intrigued, so I picked it up from the bookstore, determined to see if it was really better than The Children's Book.<br /><br />Well, dear readers, I am sorry to say that it was not. I had such hopes for this book. It is set during the time of King Henry VIII, whom we all know was an interesting character in English history. The main character and narrator of the book is Thomas Cromwell, about whom there has been much speculation. Other main characters include Anne Boleyn, Thomas More, and Queen Katherine. I went into this book expecting the best, but I was sorely let down on every front. Wolf Hall was an exercise in disappointment.<br /><br />First of all, I have to say that the writing was of a fine literary quality. I have no doubts that Hilary Mantel has a strong grasp of the English language, which is not something I can say about some authors I've read. Her only stylistic flaw was the tendency to put little artsy cliffhangers at the end of each section. I got the feeling that she didn't want to end a section without putting something that sounded either meaningful, artistic, or foreboding. While that can be a good technique when used sparingly, it came off feeling very contrived to me, like she was trying a little too hard. By the time I got to the middle of the book, which is a good 600 pages long, I was over it.<br /><br />The main problem with this book was its lack of both character development and plot. First, the plot. I got to the end of the book not really sure what the point was. Quite frankly, I was expecting there to be more pages, because I didn't feel like the book had gone anywhere or come to any kind of conclusion yet. That is not a feeling I like. There was no climax, no conclusive event, nothing that tied together all the disparate happenings throughout the book. I felt like I was reading a series of events rather than a novel.<br /><br />That would have been fine with me, had the characters made up for it. I don't need a plot-driven book if there is enough character development to make it character-driven. Sadly, this book fails on all fronts when it comes to characters. Our narrator, Thomas Cromwell, is so nebulous that he almost doesn't have a character to develop. His defining traits consist of a willingness to please the people he works for, a gift for business and diplomacy, and a tendency to treat his underlings well. That's what we start with at the beginning of the book, and that's what we're left with at the end. I had trouble believing he had aged at all throughout the course of the novel simply because he changed so little. Sadly, all the characters in the book are relatively similar to him, if not in character traits, than in voice. Though they are described as being very different, I had trouble distinguishing between characters. While their political leanings may have been different, there was hardly a difference between the voices of Thomas More, Anne Boleyn, or any other character. Mantel should take note that dialogue without tags or quotation marks (which is a device I actually like when used correctly) only works if the characters are distinct enough not to need them. Sadly, this was not the case in Wolf Hall.<br /><br />There were a few things I liked about this book. Like I said, the writing itself was not bad, which is always a positive thing. I enjoyed that Mantel gave a fresh perspective on some very tired historical figures. I can't tell you how many saintly depictions of Thomas More I've read in my day, so it was nice to see him in a different (read: heartless and heretic-burning) light. Still, this book was mostly a let-down. It wasn't terrible enough for me to hate it, but rather squarely mediocre in every category. In my opinion, Wolf Hall should not have beat The Children's Book for the Booker prize, and I do not recommend it. <br /><br />Rating: 3<br /><br />No character development, very little plot, mediocre overall. Not recommended.</span></div></div></div></section></section><section class="ReviewCard__tags"><ul class="CollapsableList"><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/2302019?shelf=award-winners"

Jesus pity my simplicity. I have promoted you to a place in this kingdom that no one, no one of your breeding has ever held in the whole of the history of this realm.’ He drops his voice. ‘Do you think it is for your personal beauty? The charm of your presence? I keep you, Master Cromwell, because you are as cunning as a bag of serpents…..’’<br /><br />'Someone asks him if he wants to confess. <br />‘Must I’?<br />‘Yes, sir, or you will be thought a sectary.’<br />But my sins are my strength, he thinks; the sins I have done, that others have not even found the opportunity of committing. I hug them close; they’re mine. Besides, when I come to judgement I mean to come with a memorandum in my hand: I shall say to my Maker, I have fifty items here; possibly more.‘'<br /><br />I love historical fiction and without a doubt this is one of the best, if not the best, history book I’ve read so far. I saved the last thirty or so pages for this weekend, just to read them slowly. This is a book to read slowly, to take it all in, the story, the love and the tragedy, the cruelty of the happenings, the poetry of the words….So I took my time with this book, but also because it’s not an easy to read story. Challenging in many ways. Like many readers probably I had to look back constantly to the Cast of Characters at the start of the book, who is who… and in the beginning you keep wondering who is telling the story. Who is he? Several possibilities but in the end, often the he is Cromwell himself. And the story goes to and fro with substories, locations, anecdotes, in time. So it’s a story that needs full attention 24/7. <br /><br />It’s like getting inside the head of Thomas Cromwell, witnessing his thoughts, views, feelings, and we witness the rise of Cromwell, as a son of a blacksmith to one of Henry VIII’s most influential advisors in times of turmoil, dealing with colourful characters such as Cardinal Wolsey, Thomas More, Anna Boleyn and many more. Fascinating. Cromwell the politician, the schemer, the emotional man, the compromiser, the protector, the cunning man, the vulnerable man, the executor, the business man, the family man… A lot of books have been written around Cromwell, but never one like this, such an up close personal portrait. This is what Hilary Mantel says: ‘I admire him for his tenacity, his endurance and his brilliant politician’s brain. He was a visionary, but a practical one. One of those rare people who can grasp the big picture and down the details.’<br />A grand book, loved it. <br /><br />Note: Last night I stayed up late to watch all of disk one of Wolf Hall the TV series and I loved it too on screen. Had to get used to the actor who plays Cromwell, but he is growing on me. I got so inspired I started reading Bring up the Bodies today. And again... the first pages... beautiful writing, I'll take my time and read it slowly...</span></div></div></div></section></section><section class="ReviewCard__tags"><ul class="CollapsableList"><a

just started Wolf Hall, and I find the relentless use of \"he\" to be extremely irritating. In the first several chapters, there are dozens of instances where it is not clear who is speaking. Every once in a while, as if recognizing the problem she has created, Mantel uses the phrase \"he, Cromwell.\" Why not just say Cromwell?\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eUnless there is some good reason which I can't imagine, this sort of obfuscation is just lazy writing which disrespects the reader. May I re-think that, based on a comment by another reader. It's not lazy writing. It's very purposeful. And very distracting.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e... later ... \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eI just read some of the amazon reviews. There are actually quite a few readers who found the \"he\" business as disconcerting as I did, and who expressed their displeasure in rather strong terms, along with many *-star ratings. However, many others really liked the book, as do many Goodreads readers, so it must not bother them as it does me. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAnother Goodreads reader suggested that the use of \"he\" all the time created a closer intimacy with Cromwell. Perhaps, but I see it differently. If you want to create intimacy, use the first person. Then it is clear that everything is seen and felt by the single protagonist, and the reader can share that character's viewpoint, thoughts and feelings. What Mantel has done is not to bring us close to Cromwell, but to inject herself, the author, between the reader and the prime character. She does this on practically every page and I find it jarring every time it happens.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eBefore my final negative notes, let me say that Mantel clearly has an exquisite command of the language. Even in the few chapters I read, her elegant choice of words often made me reflect and smile. She can paint a picture when describing a character or a setting that is truly wonderful. And, when she chooses to do so, she writes a vivid scene that has power and emotion.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eSuch continuity of story, however, is the exception rather than the rule. The constant switching of time and place, often without the merest hint of transition, made the reading much more difficult than it had to be. Just a word here or there would have made a huge difference.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eFinally, the breezy style in which much of the book is written is entertaining, as many have noted and I agree, but it had the effect of making me wonder if Mantel was as true to the history as I think a historical fiction should be. Of course the dialogue and many of the personal incidents are made up, but does the author, when portraying actual events, present them accurately? I think such concern for the truth is an obligation of an author when writing about historical characters and events. Mantel left me unsure.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eI think I've had enough of Wolf Hall, and perhaps other Goodreads readers have had enough of my criticism of what is surely a popular book. I don't usually write negative opinions, but this book just seemed to drag them out of me. I hope I have not offended anyone.","rating":1,"shelving":{"__typename":"Shelving","shelf":{"__typename":"Shelf","name":"read","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/2231715?shelf=read"},"taggings":[{"__typename":"Tagging","tag":{"__typename":"Tag","name":"fiction-historical","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/2231715?shelf=fiction-historical"}}],"webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/257869341"},"likeCount":696,"viewerHasLiked":null,"commentCount":149,"viewerCanComment({\"resourceType\":\"review\"})":null},"User:1336988":{"id":1336988,"__typename":"User","legacyId":1336988,"imageUrlSquare":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/users/1628512565i/1336988._UX200_CR0,32,200,200_.jpg","isAuthor":false,"textReviewsCount":410,"viewableName":"window","isBlockedByViewer":false,"webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1336988-window","contributor":null,"isFollowing":false,"isFriend":false,"followersCount":33},"Review:kca://review:goodreads/amzn1.gr.review:goodreads.v1.tAywiL88dgIZbX44ovHbcA":{"id":"kca://review:goodreads/amzn1.gr.review:goodreads.v1.tAywiL88dgIZbX44ovHbcA","__typename":"Review","book":{"__ref":"Book:kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.N0UwP5SK_u0L03LxZHeL3w"},"creator":{"__ref":"User:1336988"},"recommendFor":null,"updatedAt":1529707389788,"createdAt":1295724609000,"spoilerStatus":false,"lastRevisionAt":1298420596000,"text":"Have you ever been with a group of people when someone tells a joke and the rest of the group thinks it's hilarious but you just don't get it? \u003ci\u003eWolf Hall\u003c/i\u003e was that way for me. So many people think it's brilliant while I couldn't maintain enough interest to finish it.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eI love historical fiction, especially from this time period, so I expected to really like this one. I thought that telling the story of Henry VIII from the viewpoint of Cromwell was an interesting twist and I looked forward to learning more about him. So what was the problem?\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eWell, for starters, the writing style took turns irritating and confusing me. Quotation marks are apparently optional, making it hard to figure out that you're reading dialogue until you get to the \"he said\". Speaking of which, the author relies heavily on the pronoun \"he\" and since there were frequently at least 2 men in each scene, this reader was often unsure which he was the right he. As the men in scene multiplied, so did the confusion. It took so much effort to figure out who was who and who said what and what was going on that it stopped being entertaining or thought-provoking and just became work.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAnd did I mention the colon? The poor, lonesome, and oft-ignored colon finally has his time in the spotlight in this novel. Upgraded from lonely punctuation understudy, the colon has a lead role here. The author uses colons so frequently and somewhat oddly that I would recommend a complete colonectomy. Here's an example from one paragraph: (Aargh! A colon! It must be contagious.)\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\"But by the time he reaches Dover the big gash on his scalp has closed, and the tender parts inside, he trusts, have mended themselves: kidneys, lungs, and heart.\" \"Morgan Williams will have done an inventory of him before he left: teeth (miraculously) still in his head, and two eyes, miraculously seeing. Two arms, two legs: what more do you want?\"\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eOverall, the book felt like it was trying too hard to be literary. Some of the prose was lovely, but there were enough little stylistic choices that annoyed me to put me off.

The 16th century was supposed to be the return of the Age of Camelot when his older brother, Arthur, claimed his birthright and became king of England. It was Arthur that had been tutored and trained to be king. Henry would have been destined for the church if not for the fickleness of fate that left his brother dead six months before his sixteenth birthday. Henry the Eighth rules like a second son that was always second best. He is impetuous, bombastic, corpulent, and prone to fits of fury. He is not a stupid man and always surrounded himself with intelligent men, disciplined men, who could provide him with wise counsel. He did not always take their advice, but he did always give them a chance to make a case. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://s1183.photobucket.com/user/jkeeten/media/Henry_VIII_Belvoir_Castle_zpsc80c4f03.jpg.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003e\n  \u003cimg src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1532607948i/26031458._SY540_.jpg\" alt=\" photo Henry_VIII_Belvoir_Castle_zpsc80c4f03.jpg\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\"\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eThe most iconic image of Henry the Eighth painted by Holbein as a mural in Whitehall Palace.

Cromwell is a lot of things, a complicated man, a sometimes hard man, but ultimately he is a survivor. It is so interesting that Hilary Mantel decided to paint a more sympathetic picture of him than what I’d previously thought him to be. He understood money and that true power does not reside with the man on the throne. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci\u003e”The world is not run from where he thinks. Not from his border fortresses, not even from Whitehall. The world is run from Antwerp, from Florence, from places he has never imagined; from Lisbon, from where the ships with sails of silk drift west and are burned up in the sun. Not from castle walls, but from countinghouses, not by the call of the bugle but by the click of abacus, not by the grate and click of the mechanism of the gun but by the scrape of the pen on the page of the promissory note that pays for the gun and the gunsmith and the powder and shot.”\u003c/i\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://s1183.photobucket.com/user/jkeeten/media/ThomasMore_zps1e8368c9.jpg.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003e\n  \u003cimg src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1532607948i/26031460._SY540_.jpg\" alt=\" photo ThomasMore_zps1e8368c9.jpg\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\"\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eThomas More by Hans Holbein.\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI first met Thomas More through his book Utopia in a class in college. The Praise of Folly by Erasmus was also required reading for the same class. I thought both books were fantastic because to truly understand the writings of these two important writers one must explore the history behind the books. So I wanted to love More, but as I learned more about him the title of his book became more and more an inappropriate extension of the man. His view of how the real world should work was not the Utopia he persuaded me could exist. He was opposed to the Protestant Reformation. He, with great fervor, began to hunt down anyone connected to the Reformation and interrogate, torture and burn them. He didn’t keep his distance from it. He was frequently down in the stench and the squalor of the dungeons watching his prisoners being broken on the rack. The flames of burning heretics danced in his eyes. He may have taken too much pleasure in his work. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy theory is anyone who wears a hairshirt all the time and scourges themselves for evening entertainment is not someone I want making decisions about my life.

This puts the King in direct conflict with one of his most trusted advisers the before mentioned Thomas More. Sir Thomas cannot break with his beliefs. When he is asked to sign an oath supporting the King he refuses. He certainly had a martyr complex. In fact Cromwell in a last ditch effort to try and save More’s life points out his hubris in thinking of himself as a Christ figure. It was to no avail. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI do believe that Cromwell feels an uneasiness about the fates of the powerful men who came before him. He is always trying to hedge his bets, loaning money at ridiculous low interests to the aristocrats, soothing the relationship between Anne and her sister Mary (Henry’s current favorite bed warmer as he waits for Anne to pop open her corset.), taking care of embarrassing circumstances for other people, forming alliances with the enemies of his friends, and being kind to Henry’s only surviving child (Mary) with Catherine. He is always trying to anticipate the future. He worked to soften the blows to his enemies believing that someday they would be potential allies. He took in orphans, not just from his family, but even from people unconnected to him. He assessed their best aspects and put them with tutors so they would be useful to him in the future. He understands people and knows how to manipulate them and encourage them at the same time. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci\u003e“But it is no use to justify yourself. It is no good to explain. It is weak to be anecdotal. It is wise to conceal the past even if there is nothing to conceal. A man's power is in the half-light, in the half-seen movements of his hand and the unguessed-at expression of his face. It is the absence of facts that frightens people: the gap you open, into which they pour their fears, fantasies, desires.”\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHe is but a man and there is no time when that is more evident than when his daughter Grace dies. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci\u003e”Grace dies in his arms; she dies easily, as naturally as she was born. He eases her back against the damp sheet: a child of impossible perfection, her fingers uncurling like thin white leaves. I never knew her, he thinks; I never knew I had her. It has always seemed impossible to him that some act of his gave her life, some unthinking thing that he and Liz did, on some unmemorable night.”\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe sweating sickness took his wife and both his daughters leaving only him and his son Gregory alive. Maybe those deaths is why he felt so compelled to fill his house with children. It didn’t have to be his children. He thought all children were salvageable, moldable, if encouraged to work at being better at what they were best at. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCromwell grew up the son of a blacksmith. His father beat him so severely, in fact the book opens with a scene that showed the impassioned brutality that his father was capable of, that Cromwell leaves to join the army and seek his fortune abroad. He taught himself to read. He was always working his mind like a muscle making it stronger with every book he read. With every moment he spent studying the workings of economics, politics, and psychology (he didn’t know that was what it was called.) he was giving himself the means to make better decisions, to offer better advice, to hone his cunning. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHe was truly a self made man who by sheer audacity and brilliance made it to the pinnacles of power. When he becomes sick though and is at his most vulnerable the fears of a child creep into his mind. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci\u003e”On the stairs he can hear the efficient, deathly clip of his father’s steel-tipped boots.”\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://s1183.photobucket.com/user/jkeeten/media/Hilary-Mantel_zps3c13b602.jpg.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003e\n  \u003cimg src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1532607948i/26031461.jpg\" alt=\" photo Hilary-Mantel_zps3c13b602.jpg\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\"\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eHilary Mantel, what big eyes you have.\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLittle is known about the early life of Thomas Cromwell. He would be pleased to know that. He was much more interested in knowing everything about everyone and careful about letting others know anything about him. He was a long game thinker. Something he does one day may not make sense to those around him until much later when the dominoes fall a new direction. Mantel will clothe him, put flesh on his bones, share his innermost thoughts, and show you a man capable of being ruthless, but just as likely to be compassionate. Though Henry was particularly fascinated with lopping off heads Cromwell knew that ultimately as you eliminate one enemy you only create more. If possible it is much smarter to blackmail, confuse, or convince an arch enemy, maybe not to be friends that would be expecting too much, but at least to become a passive challenger. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are a lot of Thomas’s in this book and at times it can seem confusing, but the rule of thumb is if you are not clear about who is speaking or who is sharing their inner thoughts that would be Thomas Cromwell. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWinner of the Man Booker Prize in 2009 and highly recommended by this dedicated reader. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you wish to see more of my most recent book and movie reviews, visit \u003ca target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" href=\"http://www.jeffreykeeten.com\"\u003ehttp://www.jeffreykeeten.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also have a Facebook blogger page at:\u003ca target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/JeffreyKeeten\"\u003ehttps://www.facebook.com/JeffreyKeeten\u003c/a\u003e","rating":5,"shelving":{"__typename":"Shelving","shelf":{"__typename":"Shelf","name":"read","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/3427339?shelf=read"},"taggings":[{"__typename":"Tagging","tag":{"__typename":"Tag","name":"cromwell","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/3427339?shelf=cromwell"}}],"webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/975607883"},"likeCount":426,"viewerHasLiked":null,"commentCount":103,"viewerCanComment({\"resourceType\":\"review\"})":null},"User:416390":{"id":416390,"__typename":"User","legacyId":416390,"imageUrlSquare":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/users/1224113172i/416390._UX200_CR0,47,200,200_.jpg","isAuthor":false,"textReviewsCount":2068,"viewableName":"Paul Bryant","isBlockedByViewer":false,"webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/416390-paul-bryant","contributor":null,"isFollowing":false,"isFriend":false,"followersCount":7703},"Review:kca://review:goodreads/amzn1.gr.review:goodreads.v1.0KLK5cEzTo_R-8tzKoAJcg":{"id":"kca://review:goodreads/amzn1.gr.review:goodreads.v1.0KLK5cEzTo_R-8tzKoAJcg","__typename":"Review","book":{"__ref":"Book:kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.N0UwP5SK_u0L03LxZHeL3w"},"creator":{"__ref":"User:416390"},"recommendFor":null,"updatedAt":1644109964496,"createdAt":1338848668000,"spoilerStatus":false,"lastRevisionAt":1360541375000,"text":"For the first 100 pages I was like a Monkees song, you know the one -\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e[Cue cute organ/guitar intro]\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI thought great historical novels about the 16th century were only true in fairy tales\u003cbr\u003eMeant for someone else but not for me\u003cbr\u003eMmm, historical novelists were out to get me\u003cbr\u003eThat's the way it seemed\u003cbr\u003eDisappointment haunted all my dreams\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci\u003eThen I read Wolf Hall !

But there is none.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere’s more. There’s a brilliant JG Ballard short story called \u003ci\u003eThe Garden of Time\u003c/i\u003e. A guy potters around in his beautiful garden and in the mid-distance he can see an enormous hostile army approaching across the landscape. It seems to be in slow motion. Every day it’s a little nearer. Neither he nor his wife has any thoughts of moving away. They look after the exquisite flowers, they repot plants, they discuss borders. It’s a great metaphor. Wolf Hall is in slow motion. There’s the painfully attenuated downfall of Cardinal Wolsey. Then there’s the even more excruciatingly drawn out overarching issue of the Great Matter of the King’s Divorce, or Annulment, whatever. Off with the Katherine and on with the Anne. \u003cbr\u003eSo here’s a funny thing. After the great Cardinal Wolsey (and he is a great character, I loved him) - after he’s dead and gone, (none of this is plot spoiler, this is history! – it’s quite a trick to write a long story which everyone knows and still have them queuing round the block) I was scratching my head and thinking that although I’d been hearing so much of and about Cardinal Wolsey (he is the Penn to Thomas Cromwell’s Teller) in the months days hours minutes seconds of his huge demise I still couldn’t figure out exactly why - why - why King Henry turned on him in such fury. A quick Wikipedia gave me this: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci\u003eWolsey had failed [to get the King’s marriage annulled] and was dismissed from public office in 1529. Wolsey then began a secret plot to have Anne Boleyn forced into exile and began communicating with the Pope to that end. When this was discovered, Henry ordered Wolsey's arrest\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhoah. Unless I fell asleep during the crucial bit, that is not in the book. Don’t you think it should be? Might help explain things a bit better? How strange of Hilary.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo if Hilary Mantel wrote a novel about the Kennedy assassination you would have got lots of detailed scenes of life at the court of the Kennedys, the domestic problems of the Oswalds, their life in Russia, what the crowds were saying on the Dealey Plaza, but when the motorcade appeared she would cut immediately to the autopsy and the comments of the surgeons and their family situations. We would get a few scenes with Jack Ruby and his pals, but next thing you know he’d be under arrest. Huh, what happened?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt’s like being on the inside, but \u003ci\u003ethe outside of the inside.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat are we taught about drama? Exposition, complication, resolution (comedy); exposition, conflict, catastrophe (tragedy). What does Hilary do? Throws the rules away. Hilary, and this goes double for A Place of Greater Safety, her vast novel about the French Revolution, goes for : exposition, complication, more exposition, more and more exposition, more complication. Where’s the conflict? Off stage. Is this a problem? It is going to be, for some people. Quentin Tarantino fans, players of Thrill Kill and Mortal Kombat, you know, impatient types.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eNOT ZOMBIES OR PUPPETS\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eBut historical novelists, especially those like Hilary who embroider their worlds so lavishly, and set the right birds in each tree at the right angle, and the weeds underfoot, and the stench of the straw in the barn, and the wounds of a knife fight as well as each bauble, buckle, bead, biggins and bodice I think do us a grand service, re-plugging us back into the people who we were, making it possible to think that life did indeed go on in almost recognisable forms 500 years ago. It’s like claiming these lives back, scraping off the encrustings of ignorance and they don’t look like zombies or puppets. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome literature fans tend to get their sneery faces on and call historical fiction middlebrow. They do! Although I know what they mean, there are brows (brows = class), there are three main classes and they each have a brow, it’s straightforward enough. What are Darconville’s Cat, Wittgenstein’s Mistress, The Pale King, Invisible Cities, Ulysses, Mrs Dalloway and Life : A User’s Guide? Highbrow – a clue is in the fact that none of them can tell a story worth a damn but the things they do with language constitute a legal high. So then, lowbrow must be the mindless genre churn you get in the lovely world of – er - Romance, for instance – they have titles like Come Away with Me, This Man, Dark Soul, Beautiful Disaster. Probably that sounds insulting to Romance fans but hey, come on, you know this stuff is popcorn and not haute cuisine, right? You ain’t kidding yourselves are you? And there’s all kinds of interesting authors who rescued formerly lowbrow genres and made them into middlebrow literature – Hammett and Chandler for detective stories, McMurtry for Westerns, Ballard and a zillion others for science fiction (which was originally considered to be as wretched as the other low genres)… but I am wandering from the subject which is – everything that’s not high or low is in the middle ( that’s in the Bible, Habbakuk 10:4). Therefore Hilary Mantel is middlebrow.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOkay, so what, we can’t dine on foi gras all the livelong day, but if this is middle it’s somewhere near the top of the middle bangin’ on the ceiling, and eventually, who cares about these distinctions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eThe Great Matter of the King’s Divorce - a historical note\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYeah, you can think that this was some egotistical tyrannical English king thinking with his royal member and stamping on the floor until he got what he wanted even if that meant excommunication and the sundering of the Church, but actually - he wanted an heir – a son – because of the succession, because if the succession wasn’t clear and undisputed, there would be a certain return of the fratricidal civil war which had gone on for 50 years prior to Henry’s father’s victory – so it wasn’t, in fact, a trivial matter.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eTwo great quotes\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCromwell is faced with a recalcitrant noble who’s making a terrible fuss about his ancient rights and privileges. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci\u003eHow can he explain it to him? The world isn’t run from where he thinks. Not from his border fortresses, not even from Whitehall. The world is run from Antwerp, from Florence, from places he has never imagined; from Lisbon, from where the ships with sails of silk drift west and are burned up in the sun. Not from castle walls but from counting houses, not by the call of the bugle but by the click of the abacus, not by the grate and click of the mechanism of the gun but by the scrape of the pen on the page of the promissory note that pays for the gun and the gunsmith and the powder and shot.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eand\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen have I ever forced anyone to do anything, he starts to say : but Richard cuts in, ‘No you don’t, I agree, it’s just that you are practised at persuading, and sometimes it’s quite difficult, sir, to distinguish being persuaded by you from being knocked down in the street and stamped on.’\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis novel took me so many hours to read but you know I don’t want them back, Hilary Mantel can keep them. \u003cbr\u003e","rating":4,"shelving":{"__typename":"Shelving","shelf":{"__typename":"Shelf","name":"read","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/416390?shelf=read"},"taggings":[{"__typename":"Tagging","tag":{"__typename":"Tag","name":"novels","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/416390?shelf=novels"}},{"__typename":"Tagging","tag":{"__typename":"Tag","name":"bookers","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/416390?shelf=bookers"}}],"webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/342455128"},"likeCount":387,"viewerHasLiked":null,"commentCount":83,"viewerCanComment({\"resourceType\":\"review\"})":null},"Book:kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.cSiU7iWz8LgVkfzkwEbXEg":{"id":"kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.cSiU7iWz8LgVkfzkwEbXEg","__typename":"Book"},"User:1526851":{"id":1526851,"__typename":"User","legacyId":1526851,"imageUrlSquare":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/users/1291462190i/1526851._UX200_CR0,50,200,200_.jpg","isAuthor":false,"textReviewsCount":1237,"viewableName":"Will Byrnes","isBlockedByViewer":false,"webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1526851-will-byrnes","contributor":null,"isFollowing":false,"isFriend":false,"followersCount":117453},"Review:kca://review:goodreads/amzn1.gr.review:goodreads.v1.aOyDkdZx-mtsMUxZutnHRw":{"id":"kca://review:goodreads/amzn1.gr.review:goodreads.v1.aOyDkdZx-mtsMUxZutnHRw","__typename":"Review","book":{"__ref":"Book:kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.cSiU7iWz8LgVkfzkwEbXEg"},"creator":{"__ref":"User:1526851"},"recommendFor":null,"updatedAt":1643996332172,"createdAt":1426678424000,"spoilerStatus":false,"lastRevisionAt":1554955329521,"text":"\u003cblockquote\u003e\n  \u003cb\u003eThe fate of peoples is made like this, two men in small rooms.

Already married, but wifey does not pop out a male heir? What’s a king to do? Why, twist, turn, beg, borrow, steal, threaten, intimidate, and murder until you get your way. Spoiled children with their own states are fond of such behavior. Of course, to a large extent, one must engage in these forms of feces flinging and head-lopping at one remove, as kings are too proud to be seen with their hands so filled, whether with their own droppings or axe handles. Thus the presence of people like Thomas Cromwell. Thank you, your majesty, I’ll take that now. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince the Catholic Church was all that stood in the way of Henry VIII getting what he wanted, H8 sought to remove it. Seizing the church’s real estate and other holdings would be a nice bonus. Selling off the stolen bits would help pay for the ever-popular urge to go to war with France. And setting up his non-ecclesiastical self as the head of his own sort-of Catholic Church, the Anglican Church, meant that, in addition to visiting horrors on the RC he would be claiming even more divine rights. And this lunatic convinces himself that God wanted this. A bit self-serving, no?

The author offers something other. Hogwarts DA Masters notwithstanding, the darkest of the dark arts is the power of manipulation. The proper words tossed near the proper ear can wreak devastation no less awful than an armored division. Cromwell is portrayed as a practitioner of 16th century RealPolitik, someone who uses his rapier wit, his power, his capacity for manipulation, his wide knowledge of the world, and his deep intelligence to serve his king. Is he in it mostly for himself? Maybe. Probably, but he is shown in small bites, talking to this one, planting spies, chatting with that one, nuancing everyone within reach to see things his way, the king’s way, and he sees that more direct action is taken when words alone will not do. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCromwell, both the real one and his fictitious doppelganger, is a pretty interesting guy, rising from modest (and, if Mantel does not mislead, abusive) origins, dashing off to soldier for hire, becoming expert in international trade of various sorts, making very useful friends and connections along the way, becoming a lawyer, and with his contact list and rep for discretion, rising as far as a low-born can rise in Tudor England. I am sure that, had he shown an inclination towards the culinary arts, he might have been considered a Man for All Seasonings. (sorry)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHe is our window on the Tudor era. Regardless of the accuracy of the portrayal, as a literary device, Cromwell is ideally placed to allow us a look into many of the machinations of the era. Questionable prophetess, the \u003ca href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Barton\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003e Holy Maid of London\u003c/a\u003e, making life uncomfortable for a wandering king? Cromwell is there. Both to hear her speak and see her burned. Anne Boleyn plotting to get around the Church’s refusal to annul H8’s marriage? Yep, TC is right in the middle. The population being laid waste by a plague sweating disease? He loses family. Cromwell was a real-life \u003ca href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zelig\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003eZelig\u003c/a\u003e of the era, with a hand in every historical pie. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat motivates Thomas Cromwell? He moves through the novel like an avatar of the author, a witness to the things the author wants us so know, but lacking much of a personality himself. The delightfully acerbic wit he manifests is hardly unique to him in this telling. One might point to his ambition, and there are certain decisions he makes or directions he takes that offer some guidance, but I never really got much of a feel for what really makes Thomas tick. Is Thomas Cromwell Horatio Alger, an exemplar of hard work, smarts and ambition paying off in the end? Is he a model for the notion that power corrupts? Does he really have morals, or merely goals? Is he a \u003ca href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/bbc/11361080/Thomas-Cromwell-was-the-Islamic-State-of-his-day.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003ereligious extremist\u003c/a\u003e or a technocrat? In a recent theatrical production, the writers took this problem in hand and decided to anchor their production on Cromwell’s quest for vengeance on all those who had seen to the toppling of his mentor and father figure, the larger-than-life Wolsey. (I absolutely see Sidney Greenstreet in my tiny mind as Wolsey) That makes a lot of sense, lending a core of cohesion to a sequence of loose scenes, a lot of this-happens-and-then-that. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1428083822i/14361581.jpg\" width=\"197\" height=\"xxx\" alt=\"description\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1428083822i/14361582._SY540_.png\" width=\"192\" height=\"xxx\" alt=\"description\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eAnne Boleyn\u003c/b\u003e by unknown and \u003cb\u003eClaire Foy\u003c/b\u003e in the role\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, Thomas is only one element here, albeit the largest. It is the era that Mantel brings to life. It was a time of big change. H8 may be established in our 21st century minds as a solidly placed monarch, but the security of his line was very much in question, thus the freaking out about producing a male heir. The Protestant Reformation was underway and the world was in flux. Plagues…um…plagued Europe and the enlightenment was far in the future. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile this look at the Tudor era is gruesome, enlightening and fun, it also shines a light, as good historical fiction does, on contemporary concerns. Torture? Check. Religious extremism? Check. TC is seen by at least one writer as a Tudor version of ISIS. Privacy concerns? Check. Government abuse of authority? Check. The one percent riding roughshod over the rest of us? Check. National wars for private purposes? Check. Issues of separation of church and state? Check. So, for those of you who have not yet taken on this large novel, and it’s younger siblings, one born, the other gestating, keep an eye out for how the Tudor era contains many of the same conflicts we endure today. Of course one might despair by doing this. Really? We have learned nothing in five hundred years? But one might also see some universality in the human condition, across time and space. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are many, many characters in \u003ci\u003eWolf Hall\u003c/i\u003e. Mantel has included a nice list of them at the front of the book. I found I needed to refer to it frequently. It can be a bit daunting to keep track of what is going on, or to discern who is talking to whom, particularly when so many of the names are used by multiple characters. Most particularly, there are more Toms here than at a convention of male cats held in a turkey farm, enough Johns to construct a considerable public lavatory, as well as herds of Harries and Henries, Annes, Katherines and Marys, and probably a few more household names that repeat uncomfortably often. You will be needing that chart. That said, realizing that TC is the author’s and thus the readers’ eyes on pretty much everything helps. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere is a very different take here on Thomas More than the one we are accustomed to. \u003ci\u003eA Man For All Seasons\u003c/i\u003e presented More as a moralist, one who stuck by his principles in opposing H8’s desire to be rid of wife #1 in favor of wife #2. In this version we are shown a Thomas More who is much more an Ayatollah than a serene wise man, as much a political player as a man of the cloth. He happily sends to the torturer and the executioner those who oppose his views. Mantel shows a bit of sympathy for H8 trying to dismantle an organization that includes such dark prigs. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1428082279i/14361207._SY540_.jpg\" width=\"196\" height=\"xxx\" alt=\"description\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1428082279i/14361208._SY540_.jpg\" width=\"201\" height=\"xxx\" alt=\"description\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eThomas More\u003c/b\u003e by Holbein and \u003cb\u003eAnton Lesser\u003c/b\u003e in the role\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe novel does not tie up neatly. There are two more volumes after all, and those who remember their history, or who, like me, are memory-challenged and need to look such things up, know how it ends, anyway. It is the journey through this often dark age that is the treat. The wit alone would have been enough for me.

I could never truly feel that the narration was being executed by a male voice, it was as if a woman narrator residing inside a captive male character was telling the story and every time a ‘he’ or 'his' comes along, it resulted in a string of confused stumblings over adjectives before I remembered again (many times) that it is of himself that the narrator is talking about. Eventually I came to understand the reason for this jarring feeling - it was not because I was not reading thoroughly enough, it was because I couldn't think of the narrator as a ‘he’ - it just didn't cut it, especially when he/she informed me with wonder of how men embrace other men.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eI wish Mary Boleyn had been the narrator, she was the only 'real' person in this narrative peopled by artificial characters, only she had an authentic voice to me and I can't help but feel that she was the character that Mantel most identified with - the novel came alive and took such vibrancy every time Mary entered the narrator's field of vision, like a deprived woman lighting up at the sight of a beautiful mirror to finally examine herself!\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAs I said, I am open to the fact that my bad experience was due to a failure of imagination on my part, so I hope fans of this book will take pity on my deprived pleasure and be gentle in their recriminations.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eCome to think of it I really cannot think of any book I have read in which a novelist tries to get so intimate with the mind of a narrator of the opposite sex.

Stylistically speaking, she is very distinctive. Very few writers wield grammar the way she does; she uses every means of punctuation at her disposal to achieve real effectual writing. At some points her writing is simply beautiful, but there are also some real difficulties associated with it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is a hard novel to read. It chronicles the life of Thomas Cromwell, and the narrative is focalised through him. However, at times it did become incredibly confusing. Mantel uses the third person, and repeatedly uses the pronoun “he.” But, who is the “he” in question? During one long piece of dialogue it became difficult to realise who was speaking. Both the Duke of Norfolk and Thomas were having a pretty in depth discussion about politics and so forth, both were referred to as “he” frequently. This may sound unusual, but if you‘ve read this book you’ll know exactly what I’m talking about. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis meant that in order to understand this novel, and perhaps even enjoy it, it demands your full attention. This is no light reading. The narrative is rich in depth and complexity. I had a few problems with some passages, so I read them again and got the gist of things. But, I really do think this would put many readers off. This requires an attentive and patient person. Also, a solid grasp on the history is vital. Mantel does not hand you the facts; she tells you Cromwell’s life story, but the rest is up to you. If you can get over these obstacles, as I did, then what develops is a fantastic portrayal of Tudor England, and Thomas Cromwell’s life. Trust me; this book’s worth sticking with. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003e Cold, cold Cromwell \u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1459260340ra/18588598.gif\" width=\"400\" height=\"200\" alt=\"description\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, if you’ve made it this far into my review, you’ll want to hear about the positives. Cromwell is an incredibly interesting historical figure, and Mantel’s portrayal of him is superb. She has evoked the essence of a self-made man who gained the ear of the King, through nothing but his own personal merits, which eventually lead to his sovereign’s complete trust. However, Cromwell is also very emotionless. He’s driven with ambition, to fulfil all that he can with his intellect, but he shuts out the rest of his life in the process. He loses a lot of family, but he gets over it very, very quickly. What he experiences would have broken most people. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy portraying such a thing, Mantel demonstrates Cromwell’s resolve. This gives him the heartlessness to succeed in the backstabbing world of Tudor politics; it gives him the nonchalance to betray and to use people as he climbs the social ladder. But, what goes around comes around, if you know anything about history, you’ll know what fate the wheel has for Cromwell. Cromwell’s relationship with Wolsey is an apt foreshadowing. I’m digressing here, my point is that Cromwell isn’t a very nice man; he isn’t heroic or likable, only resourceful and cold. He had to be to survive and become more than he once was; he had to be to gain the ear of the King, and to point him in the direction of Wolf Hall. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci\u003e\"The trouble with England, he thinks, is that it's so poor in gesture. We shall have to develop a hand signal for ‘Back off, our prince is fucking this man's daughter.’ He is surprised that the Italians have not done it. Though perhaps they have, and he just never caught on.\" \u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u0026gt;Final thoughts\u003c/b\u003e- This is a great read, but it does require a great deal of focus. I love Mantel’s style of writing, and having already read the second book, I know the problems are worked out of it a bit. But, for this book, my enjoyment was hindered by having to re-read certain passages where the writing was at its extremist. The wonder of this work resides in its historical detail, its characterisation and its creative way of making the mundane details of life seem marvellous.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e__________________________________\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can connect with me on social media via \u003ca href=\"https://linktr.ee/sean.ultra_vegan1\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003eMy Linktree\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e__________________________________","rating":4,"shelving":{"__typename":"Shelving","shelf":{"__typename":"Shelf","name":"read","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/27788046?shelf=read"},"taggings":[{"__typename":"Tagging","tag":{"__typename":"Tag","name":"historical","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/27788046?shelf=historical"}},{"__typename":"Tagging","tag":{"__typename":"Tag","name":"4-star-reads","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/27788046?shelf=4-star-reads"}},{"__typename":"Tagging","tag":{"__typename":"Tag","name":"man-booker-prize-winners","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/27788046?shelf=man-booker-prize-winners"}}],"webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/896265746"},"likeCount":233,"viewerHasLiked":null,"commentCount":19,"viewerCanComment({\"resourceType\":\"review\"})":null},"User:2302019":{"id":2302019,"__typename":"User","legacyId":2302019,"imageUrlSquare":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/users/1241920080i/2302019._UX200_CR0,33,200,200_.jpg","isAuthor":false,"textReviewsCount":99,"viewableName":"Emily  O","isBlockedByViewer":false,"webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2302019-emily-o","contributor":null,"isFollowing":false,"isFriend":false,"followersCount":105},"Review:kca://review:goodreads/amzn1.gr.review:goodreads.v1.WFl1tnC5qUsrJp2SsC0Czw":{"id":"kca://review:goodreads/amzn1.gr.review:goodreads.v1.WFl1tnC5qUsrJp2SsC0Czw","__typename":"Review","book":{"__ref":"Book:kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.cSiU7iWz8LgVkfzkwEbXEg"},"creator":{"__ref":"User:2302019"},"recommendFor":null,"updatedAt":1643165429878,"createdAt":1292361651000,"spoilerStatus":false,"lastRevisionAt":1305855897000,"text":"Do you ever wonder about why people choose to read the books they do? Well, I can tell you, I read Wolf Hall by Hilary Mantel because it won the Book Prize For Fiction in 2009. You see, The Children's Book by A.S. Byatt was nominated for the Booker in 2009, but did not win. Curious to see what book could beat one of my favorite books of all time, I looked up Wolf Hall. And what do you know, it's another piece of historical fiction set in England and written by a woman. This could be interesting! I was intrigued, so I picked it up from the bookstore, determined to see if it was really better than The Children's Book.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eWell, dear readers, I am sorry to say that it was not. I had such hopes for this book. It is set during the time of King Henry VIII, whom we all know was an interesting character in English history. The main character and narrator of the book is Thomas Cromwell, about whom there has been much speculation. Other main characters include Anne Boleyn, Thomas More, and Queen Katherine. I went into this book expecting the best, but I was sorely let down on every front. Wolf Hall was an exercise in disappointment.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eFirst of all, I have to say that the writing was of a fine literary quality. I have no doubts that Hilary Mantel has a strong grasp of the English language, which is not something I can say about some authors I've read. Her only stylistic flaw was the tendency to put little artsy cliffhangers at the end of each section. I got the feeling that she didn't want to end a section without putting something that sounded either meaningful, artistic, or foreboding. While that can be a good technique when used sparingly, it came off feeling very contrived to me, like she was trying a little too hard. By the time I got to the middle of the book, which is a good 600 pages long, I was over it.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe main problem with this book was its lack of both character development and plot. First, the plot. I got to the end of the book not really sure what the point was. Quite frankly, I was expecting there to be more pages, because I didn't feel like the book had gone anywhere or come to any kind of conclusion yet. That is not a feeling I like. There was no climax, no conclusive event, nothing that tied together all the disparate happenings throughout the book. I felt like I was reading a series of events rather than a novel.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThat would have been fine with me, had the characters made up for it. I don't need a plot-driven book if there is enough character development to make it character-driven. Sadly, this book fails on all fronts when it comes to characters. Our narrator, Thomas Cromwell, is so nebulous that he almost doesn't have a character to develop. His defining traits consist of a willingness to please the people he works for, a gift for business and diplomacy, and a tendency to treat his underlings well. That's what we start with at the beginning of the book, and that's what we're left with at the end. I had trouble believing he had aged at all throughout the course of the novel simply because he changed so little. Sadly, all the characters in the book are relatively similar to him, if not in character traits, than in voice. Though they are described as being very different, I had trouble distinguishing between characters. While their political leanings may have been different, there was hardly a difference between the voices of Thomas More, Anne Boleyn, or any other character. Mantel should take note that dialogue without tags or quotation marks (which is a device I actually like when used correctly) only works if the characters are distinct enough not to need them. Sadly, this was not the case in Wolf Hall.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThere were a few things I liked about this book. Like I said, the writing itself was not bad, which is always a positive thing. I enjoyed that Mantel gave a fresh perspective on some very tired historical figures. I can't tell you how many saintly depictions of Thomas More I've read in my day, so it was nice to see him in a different (read: heartless and heretic-burning) light. Still, this book was mostly a let-down. It wasn't terrible enough for me to hate it, but rather squarely mediocre in every category. In my opinion, Wolf Hall should not have beat The Children's Book for the Booker prize, and I do not recommend it. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eRating: 3\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eNo character development, very little plot, mediocre overall.

I saved the last thirty or so pages for this weekend, just to read them slowly. This is a book to read slowly, to take it all in, the story, the love and the tragedy, the cruelty of the happenings, the poetry of the words….So I took my time with this book, but also because it’s not an easy to read story. Challenging in many ways. Like many readers probably I had to look back constantly to the Cast of Characters at the start of the book, who is who… and in the beginning you keep wondering who is telling the story. Who is he? Several possibilities but in the end, often the he is Cromwell himself. And the story goes to and fro with substories, locations, anecdotes, in time. So it’s a story that needs full attention 24/7. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eIt’s like getting inside the head of Thomas Cromwell, witnessing his thoughts, views, feelings, and we witness the rise of Cromwell, as a son of a blacksmith to one of Henry VIII’s most influential advisors in times of turmoil, dealing with colourful characters such as Cardinal Wolsey, Thomas More, Anna Boleyn and many more. Fascinating. Cromwell the politician, the schemer, the emotional man, the compromiser, the protector, the cunning man, the vulnerable man, the executor, the business man, the family man… A lot of books have been written around Cromwell, but never one like this, such an up close personal portrait. This is what Hilary Mantel says: ‘I admire him for his tenacity, his endurance and his brilliant politician’s brain. He was a visionary, but a practical one. One of those rare people who can grasp the big picture and down the details.’\u003cbr /\u003eA grand book, loved it. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eNote: Last night I stayed up late to watch all of disk one of Wolf Hall the TV series and I loved it too on screen. Had to get used to the actor who plays Cromwell, but he is growing on me. I got so inspired I started reading Bring up the Bodies today. And again... the first pages... beautiful writing, I'll take my time and read it slowly...","rating":5,"shelving":{"__typename":"Shelving","shelf":{"__typename":"Shelf","name":"read","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/1166369?shelf=read"},"taggings":[{"__typename":"Tagging","tag":{"__typename":"Tag","name":"have-to-read-again","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/1166369?shelf=have-to-read-again"}},{"__typename":"Tagging","tag":{"__typename":"Tag","name":"classics","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/1166369?shelf=classics"}},{"__typename":"Tagging","tag":{"__typename":"Tag","name":"history","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/1166369?shelf=history"}},{"__typename":"Tagging","tag":{"__typename":"Tag","name":"dark","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/1166369?shelf=dark"}},{"__typename":"Tagging","tag":{"__typename":"Tag","name":"brilliant","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/1166369?shelf=brilliant"}},{"__typename":"Tagging","tag":{"__typename":"Tag","name":"very-british","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/1166369?shelf=very-british"}},{"__typename":"Tagging","tag":{"__typename":"Tag","name":"beautiful-poetic","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/1166369?shelf=beautiful-poetic"}},{"__typename":"Tagging","tag":{"__typename":"Tag","name":"booker-pulitzer-nobel-material","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/1166369?shelf=booker-pulitzer-nobel-material"}},{"__typename":"Tagging","tag":{"__typename":"Tag","name":"family-ties","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/1166369?shelf=family-ties"}},{"__typename":"Tagging","tag":{"__typename":"Tag","name":"favorite-author","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/1166369?shelf=favorite-author"}}],"webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1281687194"},"likeCount":197,"viewerHasLiked":null,"commentCount":41,"viewerCanComment({\"resourceType\":\"review\"})":null},"Work:kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.REX5K0LqcVqjoye0-S8jWQ":{"id":"kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.REX5K0LqcVqjoye0-S8jWQ","__typename":"Work","legacyId":6278354,"bestBook":{"__ref":"Book:kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.N0UwP5SK_u0L03LxZHeL3w"},"details":{"__typename":"WorkDetails","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/work/6278354-wolf-hall","shelvesUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/work/shelves/6278354-wolf-hall","publicationTime":1241074800000,"originalTitle":"Wolf
