Empire simmers with discontent, bled dry by interminable warfare, bitter infighting and bloody confrontations with the formidable Anomander Rake and his Tiste Andii, ancient and implacable sorcerers. Even the imperial legions, long inured to the bloodshed, yearn for some respite. Yet Empress Laseen's rule remains absolute, enforced by her dread Claw assassins.<br /><br />For Sergeant Whiskeyjack and his squad of Bridgeburners, and for Tattersail, surviving cadre mage of the Second Legion, the aftermath of the siege of Pale should have been a time to mourn the many dead. But Darujhistan, last of the Free Cities of Genabackis, yet holds out. It is to this ancient citadel that Laseen turns her predatory gaze.<br /><br />However, it would appear that the Empire is not alone in this great game. Sinister, shadowbound forces are gathering as the gods themselves prepare to play their hand...<br /><br />Conceived and written on a panoramic scale, <i>Gardens of the Moon </i>is epic fantasy of the highest order--an enthralling adventure by an outstanding new voice.<br /><br /><br /><br />At the Publisher's request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.</span></div></div></div></div><div data-testid="genresList" class="BookPageMetadataSection__genres"><ul class="CollapsableList" aria-label="Top genres for this book"><span class="BookPageMetadataSection__genre"><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/genres/fantasy" class="Button Button--tag-inline Button--medium"><span class="Button__labelItem">Fantasy</span></a></span> <span class="BookPageMetadataSection__genre"><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/genres/fiction" class="Button Button--tag-inline Button--medium"><span class="Button__labelItem">Fiction</span></a></span> <span class="BookPageMetadataSection__genre"><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/genres/epic-fantasy" class="Button Button--tag-inline Button--medium"><span class="Button__labelItem">Epic Fantasy</span></a></span> <span class="BookPageMetadataSection__genre"><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/genres/high-fantasy" class="Button Button--tag-inline Button--medium"><span class="Button__labelItem">High Fantasy</span></a></span> <div class="Button__container"><button type="button" class="Button Button--tag-inline Button--medium" aria-label="Show all items in the list"><span class="Button__labelItem">...more</span></button></div></ul></div><div class="BookDetails"><div class="CollapsableList"><span class="Text Text__body3"><div class="FeaturedDetails"><p data-testid="pagesFormat">657 pages, Mass Market Paperback</p><p data-testid="publicationInfo">First published April 1, 1999</p><p data-testid="awards"><span class="CollapsableList"><span data-testid="award"><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/award/show/46-locus-award">Locus Award</a> Nominee<!-- -->, Best First Novel<span class="Text Text__subdued"> (2000)</span></span>, <span data-testid="award"><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/award/show/100-world-fantasy-award">World Fantasy Award</a> Nominee<!-- -->, Best Novel<span class="Text Text__subdued"> (2000)</span></span>, <span data-testid="award"><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/award/show/11833-prix-aurora-award">Prix Aurora Award</a> Nominee<!-- -->, Best of the Decade<span class="Text Text__subdued"> (2017)</span></span> <div class="Button__container"><button type="button" class="Button Button--inline Button--small" aria-label="Show all items in the list"><span class="Button__labelItem">...more</span></button></div></span></p></div></span> <div class="Button__container"><button type="button" class="Button Button--inline Button--small" aria-label="Show more book details"><span class="Button__labelItem">More details</span></button></div></div></div><hr class="Divider" role="presentation"/><div class="AuthorPreview"><div class="AuthorPreview__profile"><div class="AuthorPreview__avatar"><a class="Avatar Avatar--large" href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/31232.Steven_Erikson" as="div"><img data-testid="image" class="Avatar__image" alt="Steven Erikson" src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/authors/1219169436i/31232.jpg"/></a></div><div class="AuthorPreview__info"><h3 class="Text H3"><a class="ContributorLink" href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/31232.Steven_Erikson"><span class="ContributorLink__name" data-testid="name">Steven Erikson</span><span class="ContributorLink__badge ContributorLink__badge--medium"><i class="Icon BadgeIcon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 20 20" aria-label="Goodreads Author"><path d="M9.85,5.47C8,5.47,7.08,6.91,7.08,8.58s.93,3,2.66,3a2.78,2.78,0,0,0,2.81-3A2.81,2.81,0,0,0,9.85,5.47Z"></path><path d="M20,10,18.35,8.05,19,5.55l-2.32-1L16.23,2l-2.51.11L12.23,0,10,1.22,7.77,0,6.29,2.09,3.77,2,3.31,4.52,1,5.55l.66,2.5L0,10,1.65,12,1,14.45l2.32,1L3.77,18l2.52-.11L7.77,20,10,18.78,12.23,20l1.49-2.09,2.51.11.46-2.55,2.32-1L18.35,12Zm-7.16,2c0,1.88-1.1,2.77-2.95,2.77-1.43,0-2.66-.63-2.7-2.18h.27c.06,1.37,1.13,1.91,2.42,1.91,1.71,0,2.69-.79,2.69-2.5V10h0a2.79,2.79,0,0,1-2.79,1.94c-2,0-2.95-1.53-2.95-3.31s1-3.38,3.05-3.38a2.7,2.7,0,0,1,2.69,2h0V5.36h.27Z"></path></svg></i></span></a></h3><div class="AuthorPreview__meta"><span class="Text Text__body3 Text__subdued">101<!-- --> <!-- -->books<span class="u-dot-before">11.2k<!-- --> <!-- -->followers</span></span></div></div></div><div class="TruncatedText"><div class="TruncatedText__text TruncatedText__text--3" data-testid="contentContainer"><div><span class="Formatted">Steven Erikson is the pseudonym of <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5363802.Steve_Rune_Lundin" rel="nofollow noopener">Steve Rune Lundin</a>, a Canadian novelist, who was educated and trained as both an archaeologist and anthropologist.

Subscribe here: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/petrikleo">https://www.youtube.com/petrikleo</a></i><br><br><b>Here we go. This is my first review for Steven Erikson’s highly acclaimed epic fantasy series: <i>Malazan Book of the Fallen</i>.</b><br><br><i>Malazan Book of the Fallen</i> has been in my TBR pile for one year seven months now. I’ve heard countless amazing things about the series, but the sizes, the fame of the complexities, the need for extra focus, the commitment, and the elitist jerks of the series have made me postpone starting it for a long time. Despite hearing amazing things about the quality of the series, it required me a promise to finally plunge myself into starting this grand tale. I told my girlfriend I will propose to her only after I finished <i>Malazan Book of the Fallen</i>; she has agreed to it and so here we are. It’s safe to say that my expectations for this series are unreasonably huge, and no, I don’t plan to change that for many personal reasons. Did the first book live up to the expectation though? The masterpiece quality aspect remains to be seen but the scope truly lived up to it, especially remembering that <i>Gardens of the Moon</i> is just the introduction to the series.<br><br><i>Gardens of the Moon</i> is the first book in Steven Erikson’s <i>Malazan Book of the Fallen</i> series. Empress Laseen rules the Malazan Empire with an iron fist. After laying siege to Pale, she set her gaze upon Darujhistan, the last Free Cities of Genebackis. This is pretty much all I can say about the actual main plot without spoiling anything. In fact, as a warning, I’ll tell you this. My future <i>Malazan</i> reviews will consist of none or barely of what the plot is about. The main reason behind this is that there are way too many things going on inside the storyline that it would be practically impossible for me to summarize without writing a short story.<br><br>This is a GRAND tale, and from what I’ve read, it seems like <i>Gardens of the Moon</i> is merely an appetizer for what’s to come. As everyone said, there’s no benign compromise from Erikson here. Readers are immediately put in the middle of a gigantic war without any proper background given. However, was the story itself hard to follow? Not really. Now, I don’t claim that I understand everything that happened here; I extremely doubt any <i>Malazan</i> virgins can. Reading it for the first time, I noticed that some of the events happening in the book needed the power of hindsight in order to be fully appreciated; I’ve done my reread of this book, and it is so true. Some things just won’t make sense yet, and that’s okay; you’re not stupid. If the elitist of the series call you stupid for not liking the book or not understanding it, you’ll know that they’re the close-minded idiot you should avoid interaction with. I mean it, I have never encountered a more rabid bunch of man-child in any adult fantasy novel series than the one I’ve seen in the fan base of <i>Malazan Book of the Fallen</i>. If anyone said that Malazan isn’t the best fantasy series out there, they have this compulsion to throw insults at the speaker. That said, I will say that I do love the plot and the theme that Erikson put into <i>Gardens of the Moon</i>; there was a lot of themes going on here, but my favorites were the constant decrease of humanity because of drowning in war or power. The other theme is that when gods meddle, humans became pawns in their supremacy.<br><br><b>
  <i>
    <blockquote>“Too many regrets. Lost chances—and with each one passing the less human we all became, and the deeper into the nightmare of power we all sank.”</blockquote>
  </i>
</b><br><br>Upon opening the book, you’ll immediately encounter a huge amount of characters in the drammatis personae. This should be able to give you an idea of how big the scale of the book will be. There were more than ten POV characters to follow, and there were more than one hundred names to remember. Once again, remember that this is only the FIRST book of the series; merely an introduction. As intimidating as that sounds, though, this is also where Erikson deserves his praises because despite the myriad number of characters, he managed to make sure that each of them has their own personality fleshed out. Their crumbling of beliefs, their responsibilities, the motivations, and their inner voices were distinct to read. One character doesn’t even have any POV chapter, and he managed to become the main highlight of the book. Yes, you know who I’m talking about; the mane of chaos, the lord of the Tiste Andii, the badass two-handed magic sword wielder, Anomander Rake. Suffice to say that he instantly made it to one of the coolest fictional characters I’ve come across so far. There’s one thing I need to say about the characters’ names, though. This first book alone contained some of the most memorable and ridiculous names I’ve ever heard. Whiskeyjack, Sorry, Quick Ben, Toc the Younger, and Toc the Older; seriously, how did Erikson and Esslemont come up with these names!?<br><br><b>
  <i>
    <blockquote>“He’s loyal to an idea, and that’s the hardest kind to turn.”</blockquote>
  </i>
</b><br><br>When it comes to world-building, I don’t even know where to begin other than to say that it’s intricately complex and truly epic in scope. Almost all of these were an introduction to the world of the series, and yet it’s much bigger than most fantasy trilogy already. Hundreds of thousands of histories, many races, deadly and mysterious magic, the Deck of Dragons, the Ascendants; there was a LOT of information to absorb here. Honestly speaking, if you’re not a fan of extremely detailed lore and world-building, this book probably won’t work for you.<br><br><b>
  <i>
    <blockquote>“No matter how benign the original rulers, no matter how generous the nobility, the word of Empire, weighted by might, twisted the past into a tyranny of demons.”</blockquote>
  </i>
</b><br><br>Let’s also take a look at one of the action scenes in the book just to give you an idea of how massive in scope the battle was.<br><br><b>Picture: <i>Gardens of the Moon</i> by Marc Simonetti</b><br><br><img src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1533291310i/26070293._SY540_.jpg" width="400" class="gr-hostedUserImg" loading="lazy"><br><br>The scene in the picture above depicts the Siege of Pale, which happened in chapter 2. Sorcerous conflagrations, a floating fortress, giant ravens; the second chapter of this book could’ve easily be compared to the final battle in any other standard fantasy trilogy. Here’s another artwork on what kind of imminent battle and destruction to expect.<br><br><b>Picture: One of the interior artworks inside <i>GotM</i> Subterranean edition. Artwork by Michael Komarck</b><br><br><img src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1533291310i/26070294._SY540_.jpg" width="400" class="gr-hostedUserImg" loading="lazy"><br><br>With all the ambitions and epic scope, it saddens me to say that I can’t give this book a 5 stars rating. For those of you who don’t know, I rate my books based on enjoyment and characters. Unfortunately, <i>Gardens of the Moon</i> was slightly lacking on that part for me due to a few imbalance characterizations. It’s not a surprise really, there are a myriad amount of characters here; some POV characters were just inferior compared to the others. For example, the assassin’s war storyline bored me because I didn’t care about the characters. On the other hand, characters from the Bridgeburners, Paran, Tool, Tattersail, and Anomander Rake deserves a standing ovation. Also, one other issue I had was that some of the battle scenes concluded too quickly that they end up feeling anti-climactic to read.<br><br><b>
  <i>
    <blockquote>“Only if you fail at all else, son. Taking up the sword is the last act of desperate men. Mark my words and find yourself a more worthy dream.”</blockquote>
  </i>
</b><br><br>For all first-timer to the series, there’s a good chance that the fanatics, the sizes, or the complexities of the series will intimidate you, and it’s absolutely okay to feel that way. Even if you’re an epic fantasy fan, it doesn’t guarantee that this will be a book or series for you; all those negative and positive ratings were given for valid reasons. It took me a gigantic promise in order to finally plunge myself into starting this massive tale. However, if you’re ready to chain yourself to both Erikson’s and Esslemont’s ambitious tale, <i>Gardens of the Moon</i> will be the first avenue to test your imagination to its limit. I now move forward to open the <i>Deadhouse Gates</i>, a book that every fan of the series said will destroy my soul, make me cry, and I hope it does.<br><br><b>

</b><br><br><i>P.S:<br>On reread after being done with the series, <i>Gardens of the Moon</i> was a better reading experience. There are a lot of things in this book that simply won’t make sense yet until you've read further.

class="Formatted">Hey, I have a youtube channel now and made a video based on this essay: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSLAQoYMo0w&amp;t=2s" rel="nofollow noopener">Why Read Malazan Book of the Fallen</a><br /><br /><b>Why Read The Malazan Book of the Fallen, or A Love Note to Steven Erikson</b> (Okay, not really the latter)<br /><br />If you've even attempted to read Gardens of the Moon, the first book in the 10 book epic that is the Malazan Book of the Fallen, you'll see very quickly that you're not given much as a reader. It's confusing, it's complicated, it's full of mysteries and myriad of characters and magics that you can easily become overwhelmed. Not to mention, Gardens of the Moon isn't as well-written as the rest of the series.<br /><br />Not the most ringing endorsement so far, but we're getting there.<br /><br />The Malazan Book of the Fallen series is easily the most epic series I've ever read. The history is mysterious (and murderous) and vast, the races are plentiful and old, and the magic is as powerful as it gets.<br /><br />How many times do you pick up a book that sounds epic, but you start to read and it really isn't? This happens to me all the time. Because of a drawback of the medium, there can only really be a focus on so many characters. I'm not saying it's a bad thing, but it takes away from the epic-ness. The consequences of a few characters may have far-reaching effects and the history and world may even be vast, but there's still no denying that the scope is limited. It can't really be anything else.<br /><br />Steven Erikson does something that has yet to be seen in epic fantasy. He has created the standard for what is truly epic. Some claim his characters suffer somewhat from this, many seeming to be essentially the same, but he has truly created a world that is so vast and detailed you won't care if you think this, but I disagree. I have not been so devastated as I have been in reading these books due to what happens to some of my favorite characters. That doesn't happen if you don't fall in love with characters. Then there's Tehol and Bugg and so many others that keep me laughing.<br /><br />This is also part of the genius. The characters don't even know what's going on, who's killing whom or why. They rarely even know who's actually in charge. And Erikson puts you right there with them. In addition, they're the ones narrating the story, which means you really have no idea who to trust. This is yet another aspect of his genius because as humans, we tend to want things to go our way, to see things our way, even to tell stories that go our way. Many characters are humble enough to see their shortcomings, but the story is told from very human people... well, and gods.<br /><br />And like George R.R. Martin, Erikson has no problem killing off main characters. It IS the book of the fallen after all.<br /><br />Another reason to read this series is what I call the Superman phenomenon. Erikson creates characters who have it all when it comes to magic or military prowess or swordsmanship or you name it. They are all-powerful and when they clash it will blow your mind.<br /><br />At the same time, he creates tragedy filled with pathos that at one point had me devastated for weeks. This is not a bad thing, not only is it good for the soul, it's powerful writing that evokes emotions in you so strong you feel like you've lost a friend when all you did was finish a book. This makes me wonder how he can possibly be accused of having thin characters when he made me feel like that about them.<br /><br />Finally, and fittingly, Erikson has written simply the best endings I've ever read. Any bit of confusion, and believe me there's quite a bit in every book of the series, is rewarded ten-fold with an ending that you will never forget.<br /><br />For most books, you may get a hundred pages as you climax after 500 pages worth of build-up. Erikson gives you at least 200 and in some books even more than this. The Crippled God , the final book in the Malazan Book of the Fallen, starts a part of the climax with 400 pages to go in the trade paperback.<br /><br />Simply put, read this series. When you're 400 pages in and you still have no clue what's going on, it's okay, I've been there too. It will be worth it, keep pushing on. How many authors really trust you, the reader, to put things together on your own? Have you felt how rewarding that is, have you even been given the chance? Now's your chance.<br /><br />As Logan Ninefingers always says (or rather, his father), “Once you've got a task to do, it's better to do it than live with the fear of it."<br /><br />----------------------<br />Updated Review:<br /><br />There are few books you put down and immediately want to reread. Gardens of the Moon is one of those books for two reasons. One, it's that good. Two, it's that confusing.<br /><br />On a reread I already know I missed a lot the first time, but I quickly realized I missed SOOOO much that first time and most of it is because I wasn't used to having to use my brain as much. I was constantly amazed at how much foreshadowing is in this first book. So much is mentioned from the origins of the T'lan Imass and Tiste Andii to the Jaghut and even a little about the Forkrul Assail. <br /><br />And the epigraphs made sense! They ACTUALLY made sense! I always thought they might, but they are tell quite a bit in fact. Some I was amazed actually give away events in the following chapter, but you have no idea when you first read it. You wily bastard, Erikson!<br /><br />Hand in hand with the foreshadowing I'm amazed at the level of detail in this book, there's hardly a sentence without extra meanings behind it. But the problem is - you just don't know who to trust when you're going through this on your first time and it's so hard to catch it when so much is revealed in such an offhand manner. <br /><br />I still remember being so confused the first time and then figuring something out. That's what sold me on the series and why I still consider it one of the best, if not the best out there. A second reading sealed the deal.<br /><br />Having said that I also saw a lot of why people say it's the least well-written of the series. It's well done, leaps and bounds ahead of most I think, but it can be inconsistent. For most of the series it's told in third person limited, and while that seems to have been attempted for most of this book, there were instances where it drifts to omniscient within a section. The pacing is also a bit off, but that's not really any different from the rest either.<br /><br />Despite that, I stick with what I said above. :) These complaints are drops in the bucket compared to this vast, epic tale filled with history and magic and plans within plans. <br /><br />At the moment, The Malazan Book of the Fallen is my all-time favorite series. This may or may not change when George finishes his series (in 2113, zing!), but I have a hard time right now seeing how it will be possible to top. Yes, there's a similar level of detail and even camaraderie you feel with some of the characters, but how do you top this kind of epic? I don't think there's a better feeling in reading than figuring something out that the author withheld, that's what sold me on my first read and what continues to make this my favorite.<br /><br />5 out of 5 Stars (Not even a second thought)<br /><br />Note: I also highly recommend reading this with a group, or just checking out the discussions from the <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/topic/group_folder/154001?group_id=85396" rel="nofollow noopener">group read</a> I've been participating in. Being able to toss around ideas and theories is priceless and having people to explain some of it is also very helpful.</span></div></div></div></section></section><section

class="ReviewText"><section class="ReviewText__content"><div class="TruncatedText"><div class="TruncatedText__text TruncatedText__text--5" data-testid="contentContainer"><div><span class="Formatted">If only I hadn’t put on that little black dress. Perhaps that would’ve saved this one for me. I mean, not only did I put on the little black dress, the one cutjusttothere. I did the hair. I put on the heels too. Everyone who has that little black dress or is dating someone who does knows what heels I mean. You guys have been in that mood where you really just want to go out- paint the town red like you’re Sinatra and are just, as they used to say of kings, in the mood to be pleased, right? Whoever your date is that evening will probably have to make very little effort for you to have a good time, and indeed you’re just fine with being the entertainment. I would like to state here and now that I showed up for my date with Steve Erikson with the hair and the dress and the heels in this mood. And it turns out he’s that guy. The one who will manage to irritate you no matter how many times you try to grin and change the subject, no matter how many broad hints you might help him out with. As with most dates you’ve gathered information on solely from the internet and well-meaning friends, he turns up late, it turns out he has lied about his height, is awkwardly insistent on telling you excruciatingly uninteresting stories the entire night while not asking you a single question about yourself, and then is confused when you do not want to see him again.<br /><br />Seriously, I PUT ON HEELS FOR THIS, ERIKSON. (Somehow that’s always the most insulting part, isn’t it?) <br /><br />Everyone told me you were great! This was supposed to be my happy fun vacation time with a happy fun book that I could geek out with my friends about and finally have something to talk about with them that did not involve Foucauldian analysis, Marxist delusions, academic drama or a thesis of any kind! But nooooo. Instead someone’s evil twin shows up and now I have to awkwardly tell all these people I like that I do not like their favorite book.<br /><br />It’s just that this isn’t a good book! And not even that it's not “good” in some literary way. It is clearly not “good” in that way, and it isn’t meant to be. I don’t hold it to that standard. It does seem to me to be trying to be good in a more old fashioned way more typical for fantasy- it just wants to tell a rollicking good story. But I mean… it is a bad story. I like stories. That’s why I read fantasy, in large part- I like that feeling of the archetypal coming to life in an interesting way that shows the inner workings of the recurring characters that I see everywhere in my reading. I like that sensation of a campfire at night and a bard repeating the history of a people, with flickering flames and drama and shadows and pronouncements that you can only take seriously in that setting and which you’d feel obliged to laugh at in the morning. This is a bad story. It’s cool that Erikson doesn’t need to spend a hundred pages explaining every detail of his world to us (and given how complicated it is, thank GOD for that), but the reader shouldn’t have to stop reading many times in order to try to straighten out what’s going on, who are these random people that keep showing up, how does this new demon or magic fit into anything, and most importantly, all important, why on earth should I care?<br /><br />Erikson definitely did not manage to make me care. It’s largely a function of the fact that there is such a huge cast of characters, and he spends so little time developing any of their personalities. When there is some sort of “inner reflection” by a couple of them, or “feelings”, it seems shunted in there to give his epic quest one of the elements an epic is supposed to have- it feels like he’s impatient with people being, you know, people, and would rather get back to telling me about this super cool magic battle with a demon he just invented that just popped out of nowhere. It was almost like people were necessary vehicles for him to create his fantasy world, but that cool names, and “Houses” and ranks (Son of Darkness, Knight of Darkness, Queen of Light) were the real point of the whole thing. People are there for him to be able to have fights. Honestly? It seemed like it was kind of constructed like an RPG game a lot of the time. Here is an action sequence. After this, your hero may explore this world and pick up coins and treasure to increase his value, there is an epic quest, but you can choose to get sidetracked by a bunch of others that involve various gods and spirits. Then in between each quest there’s that part where the game stops to give you an expository scene that advances the plot and you just watch, and then you take control back and go on to the next action sequence. Eventually you come back to the big quest and kill off the Big Bad and YAY YOU WIN! I can certainly see the appeal of this construction as a game, but I think as a book it doesn’t work so well, at least, not for me.<br /><br />It certainly didn’t help that in addition to the off putting construction and the poor character development, the dialogue was absolutely laughable (incredibly stereotypically exactly what satirists make bad fantasy writing sound like), the plot was ridiculous, he pulled a new thing out of his ass every five pages because… well.. because... His world building was incomplete, too. It felt like you could never trust it because he could just change it on you a minute later because he felt like it. He doesn’t hold himself to any rules. It’s like when you’re trying to make up an excuse on the fly for why you were late for something: “I forgot my keys, and then I got caught in a traffic jam, and then I passed that and there was some truck that had dumped bunnies on the roadway and I had to help save the poor things, and then I was almost here when all of a sudden Elvis appeared from the dead, riding an elephant and… well that’s why I’m late and its totally okay!” There’s no suspense because the main characters are sure to be resurrected (the alternate dimension rebirth had me laughing so hard I was crying), and the bad ones are either off screen, introduced late, or dumb. There’s some attempt at shades of grey with one character (the Adjunct) but he tells me what the point is, straight out, about five times, just to be sure that I get it, and its not that interesting a point anyway so it kind of ruins it. I liked the climactic end battle, but I swear to you even while that battle was going on, he was introducing new magic and people and not just going with the hundreds he already had after 600 pages of setting things up. If an author feels the need to do that instead of relying on the payoff from the 600 pages he already has… not good news. Not good news at all.<br /><br />I don’t know, I almost kind of feel bad saying all this. It feels like I’m making fun of someone who’s just so excited to tell me about all this cool stuff he thought of that he forgot to put it in a coherent order. It doesn’t mean that the individual ideas he thinks of can’t be cool, he just hasn’t figured out the other stuff he needs to make it interesting as well as cool. But still… lest we forget. HEELS, ERIKSON. HEELS.<br /><br />Yeah, still not over that. Next date, if there is a next date (I’m sensing some peer pressure coming my way from my crafty friends), I’m showing up in sweats, half tired and in the mood to watch reality TV. Something tells me things might go better that way.<br /></span></div></div></div></section></section><section class="ReviewCard__tags"><ul class="CollapsableList"><a

And, I did understand the majority of it 😄<br><br>Ye gods! I was a nervous wreck at the end because I thought someone might meet their <br>true death. &lt; -- I think I got that from Tru Blood but I digress. Because in this book, not a lot of things stay truly dead! They come back or get taken over or some such thing. It's crazyyyyy! I love it 😄<br><br>There was so much going on in the book but I kept up with most of it! Yay! And I loved so many characters. Paran, Sorry, Tattersail, Lorn, Toc ... and not all of them are good or are they? I felt Sorry for Sorry, she was in the wrong place at the wrong time in the beginning. <br><br>Then someone I really liked, died by stupidity but they were brought back. I thought, yay, you idiot! <br><br>BUT! <br><br>I'm totally in love with Anomander Rake! I can't help myself and omg! I will except you his description and as he's supposed to be pitch black, the image I found online like that made him look like a prune!! I liked the million other images of him, one being from Tor. <br><br><b>
  <blockquote>Anomander Rake's skin was jet-black, befitting Gothos' descriptions, but his mane flowed silver. He stood close to seven feet tall. His features were sharp, as if cut from onyx, a slight upward tilt to the large vertical-pupiled eyes. <br><br>A two-handed sword was strapped to Rake's broad back, its silver dragonskull pommel and archaic crosshilt jutting from a wooden scabbard fully six and a half feet long. From the weapon bled power, staining the air like black ink in a pool of water.</blockquote>

data-testid="contentContainer"><div><span class="Formatted">About ten years ago, around the time my first book was published, I pulled this off our shelves at home as we left the house to go to the accident &amp; emergency department with my disabled daughter, who was having a seizure. <br /><br />I had never heard of the book or the author before. I read a hundred pages or so in the small hours of the morning in a noisy, brightly lit A&amp;E department. I didn't like it at all. The style didn't agree with me and a great number of characters were coming at me with very little context. I didn't continue reading it.<br /><br />After joining reddit r/fantasy I saw what felt like several posts a day for year after year, with wildly enthusiastic fans clashing with others who found the book to be pointlessly complicated, replacing character-building with world-building, and basically a big splurge of 'stuff' that left them cold.<br /><br />After 10 years of watching this minor culture war grind on, I thought I'd give it another try.<br /><br />And the results?<br /><br />Well, it's certainly true that 2am in an A&amp;E department is not the ideal place to start this book. I got on with it considerably better in the comfort of my own home and at a reasonable hour.<br /><br />On the other hand, the book has taken me 3 months to read, which although it's a long book is a strong indication that I was never particularly gripped with it.<br /><br />It's often said that this is a complicated book, and it is. It's complicated because there are so many different things going on at once and so many different people doing them. The plot/worldbuilding encompasses hundreds of thousands of years, two continents, several cities, and dozens of characters. In addition to the several main races in action in the 'now' and the cultural sub-factions of those races, there are a number of previously dominant races constituting different strata of historical deposit, and reaching into the current story via members who've refused to die or at least to stop being involved.<br /><br />Add to this the wide and diverse array of gods (some from previous ages) many of whom are involved in plots of their own, and the endlessly varied magics called upon through a dozen and more warrens each with their own flavour, through powerful magic or anti-magic items, through demons, through god-given favours, have a great many of the main characters be wizards/mages accessing up to seven of these warrens each... And there's a lot to keep track of.<br /><br />Actually, I didn't find keeping track of it too burdensome. My main issues were +why+ I should want to - an issue of motivation to which I will return. And the fact that this then gave me a feeling of arbitrariness - as if anything could happen at any time, and it would be attributed to a new and hitherto unsuspected god, major power, item etc. In fact at the end there are three very major threats who we meet for the first time in the dying pages of the book, powers who could totally change the course of things for the characters we know. They throw around great life/world threatening energies and then are overcome. <br /><br />Everyone has their own loves in storytelling. I'm firmly in the character camp. Others are more in love with world building. I can enjoy world-building when it's allied to great characters - and by great characters, I don't mean massively powerful characters with cool skills who can set the sky on fire or turn seas to dust, I mean characters whose personalities are interesting, real, and who are changed and shaped by the existential challenges the story throws at them. Tyrion in A Song of Ice and Fire would be a fine example.<br /><br />For my personal tastes the balance between world-building and character development tilts too far towards world-building. I didn't find myself emotionally engaged with any of the characters. Kruppe was fun to read. Anomander Rake was cool in a brooding, super-powered way. But whether they lived or died, whether their plans prevailed or those of their opponents ... that never really bothered me. I was more of a neutral observer enjoying the fireworks.<br /><br />In the end all the many, many moving parts converge on the same party and a metric ton of shit is shovelled at some industrial strength fans. That was fun. I enjoyed it.<br /><br />All in all I seem to find myself positioned with the average reader of this book. I am neither in the wildly enthusiastic camp, nor in the opposite camp. I certainly don't consider my three months of reading to have been wasted time. I enjoyed the story. I was entertained. There was lots of imagination on display, lots of big explosive fights, lots of intricate build up as the many players slowly converged.<br /><br />I can now appreciate what the evangelists for this series preach, without considering myself a convert.<br /><br /><a href="https://www.patreon.com/marklawrenceauthor" rel="nofollow noopener">Join my Patreon</a><br /><a href="http://eepurl.com/cimnK1"

</blockquote><br><br>So I have stared at my phone screen for<u> approx 96 hours </u>trying to think of a review for this and I'm still left speechless, so I have vomited up some words for y'all to enjoy, <img src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1490059198i/22276970._SX540_.jpg" width="300" height="300" alt="description" class="gr-hostedUserImg" loading="lazy"> <br>if you want a proper review check Eriksons GR page there's only 3,000 of them...<br><br><blockquote>
  <b>
    <i>“Too many regrets. Lost chances—and with each one passing the less human we all became, and the deeper into the nightmare of power we all sank.” </i>
  </b>
</blockquote><br><br><b>What even was this confusing mess of a book? I'll tell you what it was a goddamn <u>masterpiece</u>. </b>I'm not even lying when I say that if you haven't read this you are missing out, if you call yourself a fantasy fan but you haven't started this series, well you must have something wrong with you. This was an epic ride and the actual bible of badassery. I love everything about this book. <b>Erikson is clearly a genius to think of something so complex and unique. </b>I was extremely apprehensive going into this book due to some statements from a few friends, apparently this book is confusing and the weakest of all ten. <b>If this is the weakest then the rest must be so amazing that they are illegal to read, due to causing heart attacks from badassery overload.</b> I'll be the first to admit I did find it confusing, but around page 50 I was able to follow the storyline, it's exactly what I expected from a world so large. The POV's switch back and forth and there's honestly <b>like a 100 main characters, </b>so yes it did get extremely overwhelming but the plot was so good that I didn't give a damn if I was confused, hell half the time<b> I had no idea what was going on </b>but I was okay with it because it was <b>SO GODDAMN GOOD. </b>Like it even had a puppet sorcerer. Not even joking that's how strange and epic this book is.<br><br>But what really drew me in was the immense world building with so much attention to detail, the details weren't over kill so I enjoyed reading all the descriptions (so unlike me). I could imagine everything vividly while reading. I also need to talk about that perfect and clever writing, Erikson is so fucking talented that it's ridiculous. <br><br><blockquote>
  <b>
    <i>“High house shadow, and a knife in the dark. A new game's begun, or the old one's just turned.”</i>
  </b>
</blockquote><br><br><b>The characters? </b> well there was many and when I say many I'm not even joking. A few stood out to me and I'm currently storing them in my book boyfriend harem. My favorite of all was Toc the Younger, I really have a thing for disfigured men I just find them so goddamn precious so i adored my one eyed solider. <br><img src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1490059198i/22276971._SY540_.jpg" width="300" height="450" alt="description" class="gr-hostedUserImg" loading="lazy"> <br><i>fanart by Zsoszy on deviantart </i><br><blockquote>
  <b>
    <i>“Toc the Younger, last representative of the Claw on Genabackis, one-eyed and half his face scarred by fire.”</i>

</blockquote><br><br>I also love the marshmallow aka Kruppe. I loved his POV &amp; I also loved his third person talk.<br><img src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1490059198i/22276968._SX540_.jpg" width="300" height="300" alt="description" class="gr-hostedUserImg" loading="lazy"> <br><br>Rake was probably the most badass character ever created.<br><img src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1490059198i/22276969._SX540_.jpg" width="300" height="300" alt="description" class="gr-hostedUserImg" loading="lazy"> <br><blockquote>
  <b>
    <i>“Anomander Rake, Lord of the Tiste Andii, who are the souls of Starless Night. Rake, the Mane of Chaos.”</i>
  </b>
</blockquote><br><br>One thing I found extremely annoying was in the ebook edition Toc's name on nearly every page was spelt incorrectly.. Here's a few examples.<br><i>
  <b><br>“Lorn smiled. 'You'll be sharing it for the next few days, Toe the Younger. We've a long walk to Pale.'<br>'Six, seven days,' Toe said. 'I expected you to be mounted.”</b>
</i><br>And another..<br><i>“<b>Toe's frown deepened, then he sat forward, his every muscle tensing”</b></i><br>And again..<br><i>“<b>And I was, for a time. Tell me, Toc the Younger, am I speaking to a Claw, or to a soldier of the Second?'<br>Toe's eye narrowed. 'That's a tough question.”</b></i><br>And again.<br><i>“<b>Toe's expression was grim”</b></i><br>Honestly my expression would be grim if I was called toe aswell. Sometimes I thought it was a new character named toe, but it was in reality just horrible editing.. Get your shit together editors !<br><br><b>And if my screaming and fan girling isn't enough to get you to read this book then your the one who needs to be punched. Recommended to all adult fantasy fans</b><br><br>Preview;<br>Okay so this book promises lots of blood, death &amp; heart shattering goodness.<br><b>BRING IT THE FUCK ON! </b><br>Like I have HUGE expectations &amp; this better contain badassery.<br><br><img src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1452828948i/17749127._SX540_.jpg" width="300" height="300" alt="description" class="gr-hostedUserImg" loading="lazy"><br><br>If this meme is incorrect I will punch someone.<br><br><i>New note: The meme was actually incorrect so now I feel<b> stabby</b>.

class="ReviewText"><section class="ReviewText__content"><div class="TruncatedText"><div class="TruncatedText__text TruncatedText__text--5" data-testid="contentContainer"><div><span class="Formatted">I began my journey into the Malazan series in a similar manner that I’m sure some others have. I was sure I’d fall on the side of those who didn’t like this. The reviews are so polarising, and so many people talk about how difficult this series is. I don’t have the time or energy for that, but all of my friends are reading or have already read this. Am I really going to be the only one who hasn’t?<br />Then I thought: maybe I’ll just read the first one, this world sounds so interesting, I feel like I’m missing out. <br />And what do you know? In my opinion, it is not as intimidating as some people make it out to be and I think you’ll not only enjoy it, but love it. I’ve been told that Gardens of the Moon is often thought of as the “weakest” in the series. If that’s the case, then I’m in for enjoying the rest of the series.<br />To be honest, I only experienced the “wow this is overwhelming” feeling that lots of people talk about when bringing up getting into the Malazan universe for about the first 50-100 pages. After that, the author does such an amazing job at placing clues, leading the reader where he wants them to go without holding their hand or spending 1,000 pages telling you about the world. <br /><br />The world was rich. There were histories upon histories, incorporating beings of immense power. I felt that Erikson did a fantastic job at portraying the various power levels of individuals, explaining their weaknesses and still making you fell in complete awe at the creatures and beings that call this world their home. I just wanted more and more of the Lore. I want more information about the Bridgeburners, the magic system – warrens, on the different races such as the T’lan Imass and the Tiste Andii. I wanted a “guide” or something that I can take to work and read instead of doing real work.<br /><br />I didn’t feel like there was a main character. This wasn’t the “coming of age” tale of some hero or the story of how a legend came to be, rather this was the story of the entire world and the pieces that came to play on it, all moved by their masters and the forces that willed them. Characters that you met were already who they had become, and I was able to easily understand and appreciate them without needing to be detailed their entire history. <br /><br />The entire book felt fast-paced. Plots upon plots upon plots were woven as all of the puzzle pieces collided chapter after chapter. It was such an exciting writing style to be able to see all of your favorite characters converge together. Speaking of favorite characters, I have a lot of them.<br />Anomander Rake, Lord of Moon’s Spawn, Son of Darkness, Knight of Darkness.<br />I felt his power when reading of him. Erikson did an incredible job with all of his scenes and portraying such powerful characters. I could almost feel the pressure of the sword when looked upon, and hear the wagon and the chains. If there’s one character I want to read more and more about, it’s Rake.<br /><br />Quick Ben<br />Probably the second character I want to know more about. Seven warrens can be used by him at one time and he is an ex-High Priest of Shadow? Where is this guy’s past and how do I get my hands on it? He was funny, exciting and powerful.<br /><br />Whiskeyjack<br />Here is a man who has become so numb to death and killing that he no longer questions it. It’s always, I wouldn’t say fun, but interesting to read about characters like this and how they handle themselves. I would say that occasionally I thought of him as similar to how I felt about Dalinar in the Words of Radiance.<br /><br />Paran<br />Paran’s story is probably the one you read about most, as he is in the beginning and you follow him throughout. I think it’s pretty awesome that he now carries Lorn’s Otataral sword and I hope to learn more about how the anti-magic works in future books. <br /><br />Tattersail <br />“Tattersail smiled. “The only death I fear is dying ignorant.” <br />Holy crap. Did that really happen? Did she kill her body to and become a baby again? She is far more powerful than I thought she was initially and was very good at playing the part. Can’t wait to read more about what happened with her and if she will be reuinited with Paran.<br /><br />There are dozens of others that I loved. Kalam (I want to see his anger unleashed), Sorry (What is going on with that witch inside?), Crokus (Tossing the coin in at the end was pretty awesome), Rallick (Otataral inside of his skin? How powerful is he now?), Tool (Lots of feeling and emotion for a supposed three hundred thousand year old creature), Toc (The scratchy eye and visions through the Warren? Where did you go my friend?), Lorn (I loved her chapters, though I am not “sad” to see her go. If she truly stays dead.)<br /><br />And let’s not forget…<br /><br />Kruppe!<br />I had mixed feelings about this guy. At first I couldn’t figure out who was playing who, but towards the end I started to see his real power and motives and ended up with positive feelings about the fat, dreaming bastard. His third person talking perspective is kind of annoying, but funny.<br /><br />Gardens of the Moon is a great book that you will enjoy reading, as long as you like Swords and Sorcery style fantasy anyway. This is the type of fantasy I want to read. For some, it’ll be too demanding. I understand this. This book is not for everyone, but it most certainly is for me.<br /></span></div></div></div></section></section><section class="ReviewCard__tags"><ul class="CollapsableList"><a

class="Formatted"><i>Gardens of the Moon</i> is the grand overture to <i>Malazan Book of the Fallen</i>, providing just a glimmer of what this massive, grimdark epic fantasy tale has to offer, which is best described below in the author's own words. <br><br><i>
  <b>
    <blockquote>"Now these ashes have grown cold, we open the old book.<br>These oil-stained pages recount the tales of the Fallen,<br>a frayed empire, words without warmth. The hearth<br>has ebbed, its gleam and life's sparks are but memories<br>against dimming eyes - what cast my mind, what hue my<br>thoughts as I open the Book of the Fallen<br>and breathe deep the scent of history?<br>Listen, then, to these words carried on that breath.<br>These tales are the tales of us all, again yet again.<br>We are history relived and that is all, without end that is all."</blockquote>
  </b>
</i><br>It was often said that <i>Malazan Book of the Fallen</i> flings the reader, whom will be expected to work hard, into the deep end. Armed with this knowledge as it is, I was still not prepared for what was to come. <br><br>Turn the first few pages and one will come across intricate maps, and a Dramatis Personae that has more names than a standard fantasy trilogy and this was just the first instalment. The characters were introduced at almost breakneck pace within the first few chapters as a sorcerous conflagration of epic proportions took place in a siege that one normally reads during the climax of a book. Structured into sub-books within a book, the second one opened in a completely new location with more new faces. Gradually though one can detect the inevitable coalescing of the various plot lines of all these characters onto a common path. By then, the story truly becomes engrossing, toil notwithstanding. It will be remiss of me, however, not to admit having to refer to the well-known <i>Malazan Reread of the Fallen</i> thread on Tor.com to assist me along the way.<br><br>The narrative was also not made for breezing through. There's substantive weight and pathos in the manner of Erikson's writing, which was further compounded with a lot of introspection and philosophical musings. Each sub-book and chapter were preceded by an epigraph, in the form of poetry or a passage from various in-world literature, with an allegory to the main story. <br><br>Even with the staggering cast of characters and its third person narrative, Erikson was able to imbue them with enough personality and individuality that made them memorable and, most of the time, relatable and likeable. It seems that the best kind of development always occur when people are thrown into a situation of conflict. I was particularly referring to The Bridgeburners in this case, a somewhat special elite squad within the Malazan Army, led by Whiskeyjack. The unshakeable love, loyalty and bonding between soldiers who have been through the horrors of war and insurmountable grief are truly compelling. The outer layer of sarcasm and humour threaded through their interaction with each other only intensifies the emotional resonance. <br><br> <i>
  <b>
    <blockquote>Whiskeyjack, a man pushed to the edge, or, rather, the edge creeping on him on all side, a crumbling of belief, a falling of faith, leaving as his last claim to humanity his squad, a shrinking handful of the only people that mattered any more. But he held on, and he pushed back - pushed back hard. <br><br>Quick Ben and Kalam, seeking to take responsibility from their sergeant's shoulders. It was their only means of loving the man, though they'd never put it in such terms.</blockquote>
  </b>
</i><br>Then there is that one character that personified the terms awesome and badass. Every single scene he appeared in was among my favourites - be it an epic scene of great power and sorcery, or a quiet and intimate conversation that bespoke patient despair and frustration. <br><br><i>
  <b>
    <blockquote>Mane of Chaos. Anomander Rake. Lord of the black-skinned Tiste Andii, who has looked down on a hundred thousand winters, who has tasted the blood of dragons, who leads the last of his kind, seated in the Throne of Sorrow and a kingdom tragic and fey - a kingdom with no land to call its own.</blockquote>

The Bridgeburners alone comprise a host of fascinating characters whom, besides the aforementioned Whiskeyjack, Quick Ben and Kalam, can be found in the likes of Dujek Onearm, Toc the Younger, Fiddler, Hedge, Mallet, Trotts, Antsy, Picker, and its latest addition Captain Ganoes Paran - a young noble whom as a boy proudly declared that one day he'll be a soldier and did end up as one against the advice of a certain weary commander. <br><br>As for the worldbuilding, I cannot even begin to explain or describe how richly imagined the world of Malazan is. I have to use the term 'people' above very loosely to describe all the sapient beings that live on this world, which range from humans to various species, both mundane and magical. The magic is complicated to say the least and my knowledge of it only extends to that of warrens (which also appear to be portals of sorts) granting the user the patronage of particular sorcerous abilities. This depends on which 'House' or magical species the warren is aligned to. With its exceedingly deep history which spanned a few hundred thousand years, there are warrens of Elder magic which are more powerful, wielded by the first ancient living beings of this world. Even the names of all these warrens are pretty complex. Then there is the Deck of Dragons - the coolest yet most difficult to comprehend divination tool I've ever come across - like tarot cards except that it's definitely magical and from what I've discerned so far, only people with certain talents are able to employ the Deck meaningfully. <br><br>This review is written both from my initial impressions as well as my experience of reading this the second time around. As a rereader, I find that this book holds up very well for a revisit. With hindsight, one can better appreciate all the hints and foreshadowing and it makes for a slightly (only slightly) faster reading pace. For those who come into Gardens of the Moon and struggle with trying to understand the composition of characters and the intertwining subplots, my advice is not to try too hard. It will come together eventually and the payoff will be worth it. Of course, there is always the Malazan thread at Tor.com to help. <br><br><b>If you decide to embark on this journey through <i>Malazan Book of the Fallen</i> (and I'll wholeheartedly recommend that you should), I bid you welcome to what may be the most rewarding hard work you'll ever undertake for the love of epic grimdark fantasy.</b><br><br><i>You can find <a href="https://wp.me/pa0WBY-Qh"

</a><br><br>Great advice anytime, but even better advice when your world is in a constant state of war. Living large as the younger generation used to say. I'm sure I'm at least a few years out of date with that term. I think someone "living large" is exactly who the universe is most attracted to, not that it is above toying with the occasional poor bastard who just happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. For it does seem as if something bad has to be happening to someone all the time, and it only seems prudent to make <b>small arm motions</b>. In the Malazan Empire neutrality is nonexistent. You must choose a side, sometimes a different one depending on the prevailing winds, but being in the middle just means the whole bristling array of creative weaponry is pointed at you instead of half. Even if you choose wisely your ability to stay alive long enough to drop the next generation of squalling infants is based more on dumb luck than skill. <br><br>If I lived in Genabackis I'd be looking for the most inhospitable chunk of icy sheep shit encrusted land that I could find. I'd be thrilled about the sheep shit because that would mean that there is something shitting; ergo, something that could land in my stew pot. The point being, to be somewhere, that has little or no value...equivalent to say an Indian Reservation. <br><br>The emperor is dead and the empress is intent on bringing all the city states under her control. There are The Crimson Guards, The Bridgburners, The Claw, The Tiste Andii, The T'lan Imass, and The Barghast to name a few of the military organizations and different cultures involved in this conflict. <br> <br><a href="http://s1183.photobucket.com/albums/x462/jkeeten/?action=view&amp;current=Bridgeburners.jpg" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">

</a><br><br>Did I mention this is an epic fantasy series? Is there magic you might ask? The air is absolutely nose twitching foul with the smell of casting spells. There are warrens that zip those of a magical aptitude from one end of the country to the other. There are mages, there are gods (bunch of ninnies), there are evil cast off creatures that are slumbering waiting for a chance to enslave the world, there are hell hounds, there are enchanted sword blades, magical coins, possessed marionettes, and assassins. I know, I know if I were reading this I would be thinking not for me. I'm not a Dungeons and Dragons kind of guy. I don't play video games. I don't as a rule read fantasy books. I absolutely <b>LOVED</b> this book; in fact, I loved it so much I think I may have been hit with a book love potion spell, so keep that in mind when you think about adding this to your reading list. <br><br>I've read the reviews, and one of the main points of concern to those that did not like this book is the massive, record breaking number of characters that are thrown at you. It is true. It is as if you have went over to Steven Erikson's house and there he is with his group of geeky (to not type cast they could be employed people too) buddies and they have been engrossed in this role playing game for the last 10 years with evolving rules and characters and you are dropped right in the middle of their latest epic struggle expected to assimilated ten years of evolution in ten minutes. <br><br>For the first few chapters my brain was reeling like a drunken sailor on leave in Shanghai. After I realized that I was drunk, I did what I always do when I find myself in such precarious circumstances. I relaxed and let Erickson's world flow over me, around me, through me, in me until suddenly everything starting clicking into place. For whatever reason Erickson with a few descriptive sentences locked characters into my head, so even when they disappeared for twenty chapters I could still remember who they were when they became crucial to the plot again. This could all be a residual symptom of the book love potion as well. <br><br>I think another problem that might occur for readers is to read a bit and leave it for a week. I could see how threads of the plot would become tangled or lost and the frustration for the reader would increase exponentially. It is a book that might be assumed to be a light pleasure read and that would be a big mistake. I read this book every day until I finished it. Family must be attended to. Work was an irritation that had to be endured, but these imposed absences heightened my pleasure once I escaped back to the Book of the Fallen . <b>I had to find out what happened to Tattersail.</b> Like the Mazalan Empire there is no way to be neutral on this book. You will either love it or absolutely <s>hate</s> adore <s>despise</s> relish it. My fingers... are not... completely... under my control. <br><br>I'll leave you with a scene from the book. <br><br><i>"Whiskeyjack's gaze strayed to one of the beds, on which lay his armor and longsword. Rust stained the hauberk's tattered chain like old blood. The links were missing in some places, torn in others. In his bones and muscles the memory of that damage remained: every cut, every blow now haunted him with aches, greeting him each morning like old comrades."</i></span></div></div></div></section></section><section class="ReviewCard__tags"><ul class="CollapsableList"></ul></section><footer class="SocialFooter"><div data-testid="stats"

This is my first review for Steven Erikson’s highly acclaimed epic fantasy series: \u003ci\u003eMalazan Book of the Fallen\u003c/i\u003e.\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci\u003eMalazan Book of the Fallen\u003c/i\u003e has been in my TBR pile for one year seven months now. I’ve heard countless amazing things about the series, but the sizes, the fame of the complexities, the need for extra focus, the commitment, and the elitist jerks of the series have made me postpone starting it for a long time. Despite hearing amazing things about the quality of the series, it required me a promise to finally plunge myself into starting this grand tale. I told my girlfriend I will propose to her only after I finished \u003ci\u003eMalazan Book of the Fallen\u003c/i\u003e; she has agreed to it and so here we are. It’s safe to say that my expectations for this series are unreasonably huge, and no, I don’t plan to change that for many personal reasons. Did the first book live up to the expectation though? The masterpiece quality aspect remains to be seen but the scope truly lived up to it, especially remembering that \u003ci\u003eGardens of the Moon\u003c/i\u003e is just the introduction to the series.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci\u003eGardens of the Moon\u003c/i\u003e is the first book in Steven Erikson’s \u003ci\u003eMalazan Book of the Fallen\u003c/i\u003e series. Empress Laseen rules the Malazan Empire with an iron fist. After laying siege to Pale, she set her gaze upon Darujhistan, the last Free Cities of Genebackis. This is pretty much all I can say about the actual main plot without spoiling anything. In fact, as a warning, I’ll tell you this. My future \u003ci\u003eMalazan\u003c/i\u003e reviews will consist of none or barely of what the plot is about. The main reason behind this is that there are way too many things going on inside the storyline that it would be practically impossible for me to summarize without writing a short story.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is a GRAND tale, and from what I’ve read, it seems like \u003ci\u003eGardens of the Moon\u003c/i\u003e is merely an appetizer for what’s to come. As everyone said, there’s no benign compromise from Erikson here. Readers are immediately put in the middle of a gigantic war without any proper background given. However, was the story itself hard to follow? Not really. Now, I don’t claim that I understand everything that happened here; I extremely doubt any \u003ci\u003eMalazan\u003c/i\u003e virgins can. Reading it for the first time, I noticed that some of the events happening in the book needed the power of hindsight in order to be fully appreciated; I’ve done my reread of this book, and it is so true. Some things just won’t make sense yet, and that’s okay; you’re not stupid. If the elitist of the series call you stupid for not liking the book or not understanding it, you’ll know that they’re the close-minded idiot you should avoid interaction with. I mean it, I have never encountered a more rabid bunch of man-child in any adult fantasy novel series than the one I’ve seen in the fan base of \u003ci\u003eMalazan Book of the Fallen\u003c/i\u003e. If anyone said that Malazan isn’t the best fantasy series out there, they have this compulsion to throw insults at the speaker. That said, I will say that I do love the plot and the theme that Erikson put into \u003ci\u003eGardens of the Moon\u003c/i\u003e; there was a lot of themes going on here, but my favorites were the constant decrease of humanity because of drowning in war or power. The other theme is that when gods meddle, humans became pawns in their supremacy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003e\n  \u003ci\u003e\n    \u003cblockquote\u003e“Too many regrets. Lost chances—and with each one passing the less human we all became, and the deeper into the nightmare of power we all sank.”\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n  \u003c/i\u003e\n\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUpon opening the book, you’ll immediately encounter a huge amount of characters in the drammatis personae. This should be able to give you an idea of how big the scale of the book will be. There were more than ten POV characters to follow, and there were more than one hundred names to remember. Once again, remember that this is only the FIRST book of the series; merely an introduction. As intimidating as that sounds, though, this is also where Erikson deserves his praises because despite the myriad number of characters, he managed to make sure that each of them has their own personality fleshed out. Their crumbling of beliefs, their responsibilities, the motivations, and their inner voices were distinct to read. One character doesn’t even have any POV chapter, and he managed to become the main highlight of the book. Yes, you know who I’m talking about; the mane of chaos, the lord of the Tiste Andii, the badass two-handed magic sword wielder, Anomander Rake. Suffice to say that he instantly made it to one of the coolest fictional characters I’ve come across so far. There’s one thing I need to say about the characters’ names, though. This first book alone contained some of the most memorable and ridiculous names I’ve ever heard. Whiskeyjack, Sorry, Quick Ben, Toc the Younger, and Toc the Older; seriously, how did Erikson and Esslemont come up with these names!?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003e\n  \u003ci\u003e\n    \u003cblockquote\u003e“He’s loyal to an idea, and that’s the hardest kind to turn.”\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n  \u003c/i\u003e\n\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen it comes to world-building, I don’t even know where to begin other than to say that it’s intricately complex and truly epic in scope. Almost all of these were an introduction to the world of the series, and yet it’s much bigger than most fantasy trilogy already. Hundreds of thousands of histories, many races, deadly and mysterious magic, the Deck of Dragons, the Ascendants; there was a LOT of information to absorb here. Honestly speaking, if you’re not a fan of extremely detailed lore and world-building, this book probably won’t work for you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003e\n  \u003ci\u003e\n    \u003cblockquote\u003e“No matter how benign the original rulers, no matter how generous the nobility, the word of Empire, weighted by might, twisted the past into a tyranny of demons.”\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n  \u003c/i\u003e\n\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet’s also take a look at one of the action scenes in the book just to give you an idea of how massive in scope the battle was.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003ePicture: \u003ci\u003eGardens of the Moon\u003c/i\u003e by Marc Simonetti\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1533291310i/26070293._SY540_.jpg\" width=\"400\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe scene in the picture above depicts the Siege of Pale, which happened in chapter 2.

For those of you who don’t know, I rate my books based on enjoyment and characters. Unfortunately, \u003ci\u003eGardens of the Moon\u003c/i\u003e was slightly lacking on that part for me due to a few imbalance characterizations. It’s not a surprise really, there are a myriad amount of characters here; some POV characters were just inferior compared to the others. For example, the assassin’s war storyline bored me because I didn’t care about the characters. On the other hand, characters from the Bridgeburners, Paran, Tool, Tattersail, and Anomander Rake deserves a standing ovation. Also, one other issue I had was that some of the battle scenes concluded too quickly that they end up feeling anti-climactic to read.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003e\n  \u003ci\u003e\n    \u003cblockquote\u003e“Only if you fail at all else, son.

Even if you’re an epic fantasy fan, it doesn’t guarantee that this will be a book or series for you; all those negative and positive ratings were given for valid reasons. It took me a gigantic promise in order to finally plunge myself into starting this massive tale. However, if you’re ready to chain yourself to both Erikson’s and Esslemont’s ambitious tale, \u003ci\u003eGardens of the Moon\u003c/i\u003e will be the first avenue to test your imagination to its limit. I now move forward to open the \u003ci\u003eDeadhouse Gates\u003c/i\u003e, a book that every fan of the series said will destroy my soul, make me cry, and I hope it does.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003e\n  \u003ci\u003e\n    \u003cblockquote\u003e“Ambition is not a dirty word.

It's confusing, it's complicated, it's full of mysteries and myriad of characters and magics that you can easily become overwhelmed. Not to mention, Gardens of the Moon isn't as well-written as the rest of the series.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eNot the most ringing endorsement so far, but we're getting there.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe Malazan Book of the Fallen series is easily the most epic series I've ever read. The history is mysterious (and murderous) and vast, the races are plentiful and old, and the magic is as powerful as it gets.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eHow many times do you pick up a book that sounds epic, but you start to read and it really isn't? This happens to me all the time. Because of a drawback of the medium, there can only really be a focus on so many characters. I'm not saying it's a bad thing, but it takes away from the epic-ness. The consequences of a few characters may have far-reaching effects and the history and world may even be vast, but there's still no denying that the scope is limited. It can't really be anything else.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eSteven Erikson does something that has yet to be seen in epic fantasy. He has created the standard for what is truly epic. Some claim his characters suffer somewhat from this, many seeming to be essentially the same, but he has truly created a world that is so vast and detailed you won't care if you think this, but I disagree. I have not been so devastated as I have been in reading these books due to what happens to some of my favorite characters. That doesn't happen if you don't fall in love with characters. Then there's Tehol and Bugg and so many others that keep me laughing.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThis is also part of the genius. The characters don't even know what's going on, who's killing whom or why. They rarely even know who's actually in charge. And Erikson puts you right there with them. In addition, they're the ones narrating the story, which means you really have no idea who to trust. This is yet another aspect of his genius because as humans, we tend to want things to go our way, to see things our way, even to tell stories that go our way. Many characters are humble enough to see their shortcomings, but the story is told from very human people... well, and gods.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAnd like George R.R. Martin, Erikson has no problem killing off main characters. It IS the book of the fallen after all.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAnother reason to read this series is what I call the Superman phenomenon. Erikson creates characters who have it all when it comes to magic or military prowess or swordsmanship or you name it. They are all-powerful and when they clash it will blow your mind.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAt the same time, he creates tragedy filled with pathos that at one point had me devastated for weeks. This is not a bad thing, not only is it good for the soul, it's powerful writing that evokes emotions in you so strong you feel like you've lost a friend when all you did was finish a book. This makes me wonder how he can possibly be accused of having thin characters when he made me feel like that about them.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eFinally, and fittingly, Erikson has written simply the best endings I've ever read. Any bit of confusion, and believe me there's quite a bit in every book of the series, is rewarded ten-fold with an ending that you will never forget.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eFor most books, you may get a hundred pages as you climax after 500 pages worth of build-up. Erikson gives you at least 200 and in some books even more than this. The Crippled God , the final book in the Malazan Book of the Fallen, starts a part of the climax with 400 pages to go in the trade paperback.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eSimply put, read this series. When you're 400 pages in and you still have no clue what's going on, it's okay, I've been there too. It will be worth it, keep pushing on. How many authors really trust you, the reader, to put things together on your own? Have you felt how rewarding that is, have you even been given the chance? Now's your chance.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAs Logan Ninefingers always says (or rather, his father), “Once you've got a task to do, it's better to do it than live with the fear of it.\"\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e----------------------\u003cbr /\u003eUpdated Review:\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThere are few books you put down and immediately want to reread. Gardens of the Moon is one of those books for two reasons. One, it's that good. Two, it's that confusing.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eOn a reread I already know I missed a lot the first time, but I quickly realized I missed SOOOO much that first time and most of it is because I wasn't used to having to use my brain as much. I was constantly amazed at how much foreshadowing is in this first book. So much is mentioned from the origins of the T'lan Imass and Tiste Andii to the Jaghut and even a little about the Forkrul Assail. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAnd the epigraphs made sense! They ACTUALLY made sense! I always thought they might, but they are tell quite a bit in fact. Some I was amazed actually give away events in the following chapter, but you have no idea when you first read it. You wily bastard, Erikson!\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eHand in hand with the foreshadowing I'm amazed at the level of detail in this book, there's hardly a sentence without extra meanings behind it. But the problem is - you just don't know who to trust when you're going through this on your first time and it's so hard to catch it when so much is revealed in such an offhand manner. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eI still remember being so confused the first time and then figuring something out. That's what sold me on the series and why I still consider it one of the best, if not the best out there. A second reading sealed the deal.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eHaving said that I also saw a lot of why people say it's the least well-written of the series. It's well done, leaps and bounds ahead of most I think, but it can be inconsistent. For most of the series it's told in third person limited, and while that seems to have been attempted for most of this book, there were instances where it drifts to omniscient within a section. The pacing is also a bit off, but that's not really any different from the rest either.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eDespite that, I stick with what I said above. :) These complaints are drops in the bucket compared to this vast, epic tale filled with history and magic and plans within plans. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAt the moment, The Malazan Book of the Fallen is my all-time favorite series. This may or may not change when George finishes his series (in 2113, zing!), but I have a hard time right now seeing how it will be possible to top. Yes, there's a similar level of detail and even camaraderie you feel with some of the characters, but how do you top this kind of epic? I don't think there's a better feeling in reading than figuring something out that the author withheld, that's what sold me on my first read and what continues to make this my favorite.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e5 out of 5 Stars (Not even a second thought)\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eNote: I also highly recommend reading this with a group, or just checking out the discussions from the \u003ca href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/topic/group_folder/154001?group_id=85396\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003egroup read\u003c/a\u003e I've been participating in.

Perhaps that would’ve saved this one for me. I mean, not only did I put on the little black dress, the one cutjusttothere. I did the hair. I put on the heels too. Everyone who has that little black dress or is dating someone who does knows what heels I mean. You guys have been in that mood where you really just want to go out- paint the town red like you’re Sinatra and are just, as they used to say of kings, in the mood to be pleased, right? Whoever your date is that evening will probably have to make very little effort for you to have a good time, and indeed you’re just fine with being the entertainment. I would like to state here and now that I showed up for my date with Steve Erikson with the hair and the dress and the heels in this mood. And it turns out he’s that guy. The one who will manage to irritate you no matter how many times you try to grin and change the subject, no matter how many broad hints you might help him out with. As with most dates you’ve gathered information on solely from the internet and well-meaning friends, he turns up late, it turns out he has lied about his height, is awkwardly insistent on telling you excruciatingly uninteresting stories the entire night while not asking you a single question about yourself, and then is confused when you do not want to see him again.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eSeriously, I PUT ON HEELS FOR THIS, ERIKSON. (Somehow that’s always the most insulting part, isn’t it?) \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eEveryone told me you were great! This was supposed to be my happy fun vacation time with a happy fun book that I could geek out with my friends about and finally have something to talk about with them that did not involve Foucauldian analysis, Marxist delusions, academic drama or a thesis of any kind! But nooooo. Instead someone’s evil twin shows up and now I have to awkwardly tell all these people I like that I do not like their favorite book.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eIt’s just that this isn’t a good book! And not even that it's not “good” in some literary way. It is clearly not “good” in that way, and it isn’t meant to be. I don’t hold it to that standard. It does seem to me to be trying to be good in a more old fashioned way more typical for fantasy- it just wants to tell a rollicking good story. But I mean… it is a bad story. I like stories. That’s why I read fantasy, in large part- I like that feeling of the archetypal coming to life in an interesting way that shows the inner workings of the recurring characters that I see everywhere in my reading. I like that sensation of a campfire at night and a bard repeating the history of a people, with flickering flames and drama and shadows and pronouncements that you can only take seriously in that setting and which you’d feel obliged to laugh at in the morning. This is a bad story. It’s cool that Erikson doesn’t need to spend a hundred pages explaining every detail of his world to us (and given how complicated it is, thank GOD for that), but the reader shouldn’t have to stop reading many times in order to try to straighten out what’s going on, who are these random people that keep showing up, how does this new demon or magic fit into anything, and most importantly, all important, why on earth should I care?\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eErikson definitely did not manage to make me care. It’s largely a function of the fact that there is such a huge cast of characters, and he spends so little time developing any of their personalities. When there is some sort of “inner reflection” by a couple of them, or “feelings”, it seems shunted in there to give his epic quest one of the elements an epic is supposed to have- it feels like he’s impatient with people being, you know, people, and would rather get back to telling me about this super cool magic battle with a demon he just invented that just popped out of nowhere. It was almost like people were necessary vehicles for him to create his fantasy world, but that cool names, and “Houses” and ranks (Son of Darkness, Knight of Darkness, Queen of Light) were the real point of the whole thing. People are there for him to be able to have fights. Honestly? It seemed like it was kind of constructed like an RPG game a lot of the time. Here is an action sequence. After this, your hero may explore this world and pick up coins and treasure to increase his value, there is an epic quest, but you can choose to get sidetracked by a bunch of others that involve various gods and spirits. Then in between each quest there’s that part where the game stops to give you an expository scene that advances the plot and you just watch, and then you take control back and go on to the next action sequence. Eventually you come back to the big quest and kill off the Big Bad and YAY YOU WIN! I can certainly see the appeal of this construction as a game, but I think as a book it doesn’t work so well, at least, not for me.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eIt certainly didn’t help that in addition to the off putting construction and the poor character development, the dialogue was absolutely laughable (incredibly stereotypically exactly what satirists make bad fantasy writing sound like), the plot was ridiculous, he pulled a new thing out of his ass every five pages because… well.. because... His world building was incomplete, too. It felt like you could never trust it because he could just change it on you a minute later because he felt like it. He doesn’t hold himself to any rules. It’s like when you’re trying to make up an excuse on the fly for why you were late for something: “I forgot my keys, and then I got caught in a traffic jam, and then I passed that and there was some truck that had dumped bunnies on the roadway and I had to help save the poor things, and then I was almost here when all of a sudden Elvis appeared from the dead, riding an elephant and… well that’s why I’m late and its totally okay!” There’s no suspense because the main characters are sure to be resurrected (the alternate dimension rebirth had me laughing so hard I was crying), and the bad ones are either off screen, introduced late, or dumb. There’s some attempt at shades of grey with one character (the Adjunct) but he tells me what the point is, straight out, about five times, just to be sure that I get it, and its not that interesting a point anyway so it kind of ruins it. I liked the climactic end battle, but I swear to you even while that battle was going on, he was introducing new magic and people and not just going with the hundreds he already had after 600 pages of setting things up. If an author feels the need to do that instead of relying on the payoff from the 600 pages he already has… not good news. Not good news at all.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eI don’t know, I almost kind of feel bad saying all this. It feels like I’m making fun of someone who’s just so excited to tell me about all this cool stuff he thought of that he forgot to put it in a coherent order. It doesn’t mean that the individual ideas he thinks of can’t be cool, he just hasn’t figured out the other stuff he needs to make it interesting as well as cool. But still… lest we forget. HEELS, ERIKSON. HEELS.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eYeah, still not over that. Next date, if there is a next date (I’m sensing some peer pressure coming my way from my crafty friends), I’m showing up in sweats, half tired and in the mood to watch reality TV.

I read a hundred pages or so in the small hours of the morning in a noisy, brightly lit A\u0026amp;E department. I didn't like it at all. The style didn't agree with me and a great number of characters were coming at me with very little context. I didn't continue reading it.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAfter joining reddit r/fantasy I saw what felt like several posts a day for year after year, with wildly enthusiastic fans clashing with others who found the book to be pointlessly complicated, replacing character-building with world-building, and basically a big splurge of 'stuff' that left them cold.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAfter 10 years of watching this minor culture war grind on, I thought I'd give it another try.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAnd the results?\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eWell, it's certainly true that 2am in an A\u0026amp;E department is not the ideal place to start this book. I got on with it considerably better in the comfort of my own home and at a reasonable hour.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eOn the other hand, the book has taken me 3 months to read, which although it's a long book is a strong indication that I was never particularly gripped with it.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eIt's often said that this is a complicated book, and it is. It's complicated because there are so many different things going on at once and so many different people doing them. The plot/worldbuilding encompasses hundreds of thousands of years, two continents, several cities, and dozens of characters. In addition to the several main races in action in the 'now' and the cultural sub-factions of those races, there are a number of previously dominant races constituting different strata of historical deposit, and reaching into the current story via members who've refused to die or at least to stop being involved.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAdd to this the wide and diverse array of gods (some from previous ages) many of whom are involved in plots of their own, and the endlessly varied magics called upon through a dozen and more warrens each with their own flavour, through powerful magic or anti-magic items, through demons, through god-given favours, have a great many of the main characters be wizards/mages accessing up to seven of these warrens each... And there's a lot to keep track of.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eActually, I didn't find keeping track of it too burdensome. My main issues were +why+ I should want to - an issue of motivation to which I will return. And the fact that this then gave me a feeling of arbitrariness - as if anything could happen at any time, and it would be attributed to a new and hitherto unsuspected god, major power, item etc. In fact at the end there are three very major threats who we meet for the first time in the dying pages of the book, powers who could totally change the course of things for the characters we know. They throw around great life/world threatening energies and then are overcome. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eEveryone has their own loves in storytelling. I'm firmly in the character camp. Others are more in love with world building. I can enjoy world-building when it's allied to great characters - and by great characters, I don't mean massively powerful characters with cool skills who can set the sky on fire or turn seas to dust, I mean characters whose personalities are interesting, real, and who are changed and shaped by the existential challenges the story throws at them. Tyrion in A Song of Ice and Fire would be a fine example.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eFor my personal tastes the balance between world-building and character development tilts too far towards world-building. I didn't find myself emotionally engaged with any of the characters. Kruppe was fun to read. Anomander Rake was cool in a brooding, super-powered way. But whether they lived or died, whether their plans prevailed or those of their opponents ... that never really bothered me. I was more of a neutral observer enjoying the fireworks.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eIn the end all the many, many moving parts converge on the same party and a metric ton of shit is shovelled at some industrial strength fans. That was fun. I enjoyed it.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAll in all I seem to find myself positioned with the average reader of this book. I am neither in the wildly enthusiastic camp, nor in the opposite camp. I certainly don't consider my three months of reading to have been wasted time. I enjoyed the story. I was entertained. There was lots of imagination on display, lots of big explosive fights, lots of intricate build up as the many players slowly converged.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eI can now appreciate what the evangelists for this series preach, without considering myself a convert.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/marklawrenceauthor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003eJoin my Patreon\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://eepurl.com/cimnK1\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003eJoin my 3-emails-a-year newsletter #prizes\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e......","rating":0,"shelving":{"__typename":"Shelving","shelf":{"__typename":"Shelf","name":"read","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/4508542?shelf=read"},"taggings":[],"webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/176061438"},"likeCount":335,"viewerHasLiked":null,"commentCount":46,"viewerCanComment({\"resourceType\":\"review\"})":null},"Book:kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.o6bJa4fRRjc_MLu1XMz-Ag":{"id":"kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.o6bJa4fRRjc_MLu1XMz-Ag","__typename":"Book"},"User:53385361":{"id":53385361,"__typename":"User","legacyId":53385361,"imageUrlSquare":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/users/1575639837i/53385361._UX200_CR0,0,200,200_.jpg","isAuthor":false,"textReviewsCount":92,"viewableName":"Luna. ✨","isBlockedByViewer":false,"webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/53385361-luna","contributor":null,"isFollowing":false,"isFriend":false,"followersCount":1156},"Review:kca://review:goodreads/amzn1.gr.review:goodreads.v1.3OOJ2xK5yCw4Dw1gzyJXOQ":{"id":"kca://review:goodreads/amzn1.gr.review:goodreads.v1.3OOJ2xK5yCw4Dw1gzyJXOQ","__typename":"Review","book":{"__ref":"Book:kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.o6bJa4fRRjc_MLu1XMz-Ag"},"creator":{"__ref":"User:53385361"},"recommendFor":null,"updatedAt":1644284020070,"createdAt":1488532350601,"spoilerStatus":false,"lastRevisionAt":1490066447680,"text":"\u003ci\u003efull review now up\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003e5/5\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e Buddy read with my \u003ca href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22984078-slick\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003esoul sister\u003c/a\u003e and my pals at \u003ca href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/group/show/148164-buddies-books-and-baubles\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003eBB\u0026amp;B \u003c/a\u003e \u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\n  \u003cb\u003e\n    \u003ci\u003e“Ambition is not a dirty word.

This was an epic ride and the actual bible of badassery. I love everything about this book. \u003cb\u003eErikson is clearly a genius to think of something so complex and unique. \u003c/b\u003eI was extremely apprehensive going into this book due to some statements from a few friends, apparently this book is confusing and the weakest of all ten. \u003cb\u003eIf this is the weakest then the rest must be so amazing that they are illegal to read, due to causing heart attacks from badassery overload.\u003c/b\u003e I'll be the first to admit I did find it confusing, but around page 50 I was able to follow the storyline, it's exactly what I expected from a world so large. The POV's switch back and forth and there's honestly \u003cb\u003elike a 100 main characters, \u003c/b\u003eso yes it did get extremely overwhelming but the plot was so good that I didn't give a damn if I was confused, hell half the time\u003cb\u003e I had no idea what was going on \u003c/b\u003ebut I was okay with it because it was \u003cb\u003eSO GODDAMN GOOD. \u003c/b\u003eLike it even had a puppet sorcerer.

I was sure I’d fall on the side of those who didn’t like this. The reviews are so polarising, and so many people talk about how difficult this series is. I don’t have the time or energy for that, but all of my friends are reading or have already read this. Am I really going to be the only one who hasn’t?\u003cbr /\u003eThen I thought: maybe I’ll just read the first one, this world sounds so interesting, I feel like I’m missing out. \u003cbr /\u003eAnd what do you know? In my opinion, it is not as intimidating as some people make it out to be and I think you’ll not only enjoy it, but love it. I’ve been told that Gardens of the Moon is often thought of as the “weakest” in the series. If that’s the case, then I’m in for enjoying the rest of the series.\u003cbr /\u003eTo be honest, I only experienced the “wow this is overwhelming” feeling that lots of people talk about when bringing up getting into the Malazan universe for about the first 50-100 pages. After that, the author does such an amazing job at placing clues, leading the reader where he wants them to go without holding their hand or spending 1,000 pages telling you about the world. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe world was rich. There were histories upon histories, incorporating beings of immense power. I felt that Erikson did a fantastic job at portraying the various power levels of individuals, explaining their weaknesses and still making you fell in complete awe at the creatures and beings that call this world their home. I just wanted more and more of the Lore. I want more information about the Bridgeburners, the magic system – warrens, on the different races such as the T’lan Imass and the Tiste Andii. I wanted a “guide” or something that I can take to work and read instead of doing real work.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eI didn’t feel like there was a main character. This wasn’t the “coming of age” tale of some hero or the story of how a legend came to be, rather this was the story of the entire world and the pieces that came to play on it, all moved by their masters and the forces that willed them. Characters that you met were already who they had become, and I was able to easily understand and appreciate them without needing to be detailed their entire history. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe entire book felt fast-paced. Plots upon plots upon plots were woven as all of the puzzle pieces collided chapter after chapter. It was such an exciting writing style to be able to see all of your favorite characters converge together. Speaking of favorite characters, I have a lot of them.\u003cbr /\u003eAnomander Rake, Lord of Moon’s Spawn, Son of Darkness, Knight of Darkness.\u003cbr /\u003eI felt his power when reading of him. Erikson did an incredible job with all of his scenes and portraying such powerful characters. I could almost feel the pressure of the sword when looked upon, and hear the wagon and the chains. If there’s one character I want to read more and more about, it’s Rake.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eQuick Ben\u003cbr /\u003eProbably the second character I want to know more about. Seven warrens can be used by him at one time and he is an ex-High Priest of Shadow? Where is this guy’s past and how do I get my hands on it? He was funny, exciting and powerful.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eWhiskeyjack\u003cbr /\u003eHere is a man who has become so numb to death and killing that he no longer questions it. It’s always, I wouldn’t say fun, but interesting to read about characters like this and how they handle themselves. I would say that occasionally I thought of him as similar to how I felt about Dalinar in the Words of Radiance.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eParan\u003cbr /\u003eParan’s story is probably the one you read about most, as he is in the beginning and you follow him throughout. I think it’s pretty awesome that he now carries Lorn’s Otataral sword and I hope to learn more about how the anti-magic works in future books. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eTattersail \u003cbr /\u003e“Tattersail smiled. “The only death I fear is dying ignorant.” \u003cbr /\u003eHoly crap. Did that really happen? Did she kill her body to and become a baby again? She is far more powerful than I thought she was initially and was very good at playing the part. Can’t wait to read more about what happened with her and if she will be reuinited with Paran.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThere are dozens of others that I loved. Kalam (I want to see his anger unleashed), Sorry (What is going on with that witch inside?), Crokus (Tossing the coin in at the end was pretty awesome), Rallick (Otataral inside of his skin? How powerful is he now?), Tool (Lots of feeling and emotion for a supposed three hundred thousand year old creature), Toc (The scratchy eye and visions through the Warren? Where did you go my friend?), Lorn (I loved her chapters, though I am not “sad” to see her go. If she truly stays dead.)\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAnd let’s not forget…\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eKruppe!\u003cbr /\u003eI had mixed feelings about this guy. At first I couldn’t figure out who was playing who, but towards the end I started to see his real power and motives and ended up with positive feelings about the fat, dreaming bastard. His third person talking perspective is kind of annoying, but funny.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eGardens of the Moon is a great book that you will enjoy reading, as long as you like Swords and Sorcery style fantasy anyway. This is the type of fantasy I want to read. For some, it’ll be too demanding. I understand this.

Armed with this knowledge as it is, I was still not prepared for what was to come. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTurn the first few pages and one will come across intricate maps, and a Dramatis Personae that has more names than a standard fantasy trilogy and this was just the first instalment. The characters were introduced at almost breakneck pace within the first few chapters as a sorcerous conflagration of epic proportions took place in a siege that one normally reads during the climax of a book. Structured into sub-books within a book, the second one opened in a completely new location with more new faces. Gradually though one can detect the inevitable coalescing of the various plot lines of all these characters onto a common path. By then, the story truly becomes engrossing, toil notwithstanding. It will be remiss of me, however, not to admit having to refer to the well-known \u003ci\u003eMalazan Reread of the Fallen\u003c/i\u003e thread on Tor.com to assist me along the way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe narrative was also not made for breezing through. There's substantive weight and pathos in the manner of Erikson's writing, which was further compounded with a lot of introspection and philosophical musings. Each sub-book and chapter were preceded by an epigraph, in the form of poetry or a passage from various in-world literature, with an allegory to the main story. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven with the staggering cast of characters and its third person narrative, Erikson was able to imbue them with enough personality and individuality that made them memorable and, most of the time, relatable and likeable. It seems that the best kind of development always occur when people are thrown into a situation of conflict. I was particularly referring to The Bridgeburners in this case, a somewhat special elite squad within the Malazan Army, led by Whiskeyjack. The unshakeable love, loyalty and bonding between soldiers who have been through the horrors of war and insurmountable grief are truly compelling. The outer layer of sarcasm and humour threaded through their interaction with each other only intensifies the emotional resonance. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u003ci\u003e\n  \u003cb\u003e\n    \u003cblockquote\u003eWhiskeyjack, a man pushed to the edge, or, rather, the edge creeping on him on all side, a crumbling of belief, a falling of faith, leaving as his last claim to humanity his squad, a shrinking handful of the only people that mattered any more. But he held on, and he pushed back - pushed back hard. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQuick Ben and Kalam, seeking to take responsibility from their sergeant's shoulders. It was their only means of loving the man, though they'd never put it in such terms.\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n  \u003c/b\u003e\n\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThen there is that one character that personified the terms awesome and badass. Every single scene he appeared in was among my favourites - be it an epic scene of great power and sorcery, or a quiet and intimate conversation that bespoke patient despair and frustration. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci\u003e\n  \u003cb\u003e\n    \u003cblockquote\u003eMane of Chaos. Anomander Rake.

The Bridgeburners alone comprise a host of fascinating characters whom, besides the aforementioned Whiskeyjack, Quick Ben and Kalam, can be found in the likes of Dujek Onearm, Toc the Younger, Fiddler, Hedge, Mallet, Trotts, Antsy, Picker, and its latest addition Captain Ganoes Paran - a young noble whom as a boy proudly declared that one day he'll be a soldier and did end up as one against the advice of a certain weary commander. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs for the worldbuilding, I cannot even begin to explain or describe how richly imagined the world of Malazan is. I have to use the term 'people' above very loosely to describe all the sapient beings that live on this world, which range from humans to various species, both mundane and magical. The magic is complicated to say the least and my knowledge of it only extends to that of warrens (which also appear to be portals of sorts) granting the user the patronage of particular sorcerous abilities. This depends on which 'House' or magical species the warren is aligned to. With its exceedingly deep history which spanned a few hundred thousand years, there are warrens of Elder magic which are more powerful, wielded by the first ancient living beings of this world. Even the names of all these warrens are pretty complex. Then there is the Deck of Dragons - the coolest yet most difficult to comprehend divination tool I've ever come across - like tarot cards except that it's definitely magical and from what I've discerned so far, only people with certain talents are able to employ the Deck meaningfully. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis review is written both from my initial impressions as well as my experience of reading this the second time around. As a rereader, I find that this book holds up very well for a revisit. With hindsight, one can better appreciate all the hints and foreshadowing and it makes for a slightly (only slightly) faster reading pace. For those who come into Gardens of the Moon and struggle with trying to understand the composition of characters and the intertwining subplots, my advice is not to try too hard. It will come together eventually and the payoff will be worth it. Of course, there is always the Malazan thread at Tor.com to help. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eIf you decide to embark on this journey through \u003ci\u003eMalazan Book of the Fallen\u003c/i\u003e (and I'll wholeheartedly recommend that you should), I bid you welcome to what may be the most rewarding hard work you'll ever undertake for the love of epic grimdark fantasy.\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci\u003eYou can find \u003ca href=\"https://wp.me/pa0WBY-Qh\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003ethis\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/i\u003e and my other reviews at \u003ca href=\"http://novelnotions.net/category/book-reviews/tss-reviews/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003eNovel Notions.\u003c/a\u003e","rating":5,"shelving":{"__typename":"Shelving","shelf":{"__typename":"Shelf","name":"read","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/30279227?shelf=read"},"taggings":[{"__typename":"Tagging","tag":{"__typename":"Tag","name":"re-read","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/30279227?shelf=re-read"}},{"__typename":"Tagging","tag":{"__typename":"Tag","name":"dr-reading-challenge","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/30279227?shelf=dr-reading-challenge"}},{"__typename":"Tagging","tag":{"__typename":"Tag","name":"favorites","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/30279227?shelf=favorites"}},{"__typename":"Tagging","tag":{"__typename":"Tag","name":"malazan","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/30279227?shelf=malazan"}}],"webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1186511130"},"likeCount":241,"viewerHasLiked":null,"commentCount":66,"viewerCanComment({\"resourceType\":\"review\"})":null},"Contributor:kca://author/amzn1.gr.author.v3.BnEoe23VwxeB9OuK":{"id":"kca://author/amzn1.gr.author.v3.BnEoe23VwxeB9OuK","__typename":"Contributor","works":{"__typename":"ContributorWorksConnection","totalCount":2}},"User:3427339":{"id":3427339,"__typename":"User","legacyId":3427339,"imageUrlSquare":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/users/1629819437i/3427339._UX200_CR0,25,200,200_.jpg","isAuthor":true,"textReviewsCount":1243,"viewableName":"Jeffrey Keeten","isBlockedByViewer":false,"webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3427339-jeffrey-keeten","contributor":{"__ref":"Contributor:kca://author/amzn1.gr.author.v3.BnEoe23VwxeB9OuK"},"isFollowing":false,"isFriend":false,"followersCount":244712},"Review:kca://review:goodreads/amzn1.gr.review:goodreads.v1.vMvN5Q3xyeFq6MS5M6BoBg":{"id":"kca://review:goodreads/amzn1.gr.review:goodreads.v1.vMvN5Q3xyeFq6MS5M6BoBg","__typename":"Review","book":{"__ref":"Book:kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.S8WstDpKFbEbtAYHzt7Q7g"},"creator":{"__ref":"User:3427339"},"recommendFor":null,"updatedAt":1643786988524,"createdAt":1335390102000,"spoilerStatus":false,"lastRevisionAt":1516333399190,"text":"\u003cb\u003e\"Every decision you make can change he world.

Living large as the younger generation used to say. I'm sure I'm at least a few years out of date with that term. I think someone \"living large\" is exactly who the universe is most attracted to, not that it is above toying with the occasional poor bastard who just happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. For it does seem as if something bad has to be happening to someone all the time, and it only seems prudent to make \u003cb\u003esmall arm motions\u003c/b\u003e. In the Malazan Empire neutrality is nonexistent. You must choose a side, sometimes a different one depending on the prevailing winds, but being in the middle just means the whole bristling array of creative weaponry is pointed at you instead of half. Even if you choose wisely your ability to stay alive long enough to drop the next generation of squalling infants is based more on dumb luck than skill. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf I lived in Genabackis I'd be looking for the most inhospitable chunk of icy sheep shit encrusted land that I could find. I'd be thrilled about the sheep shit because that would mean that there is something shitting; ergo, something that could land in my stew pot. The point being, to be somewhere, that has little or no value...equivalent to say an Indian Reservation. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe emperor is dead and the empress is intent on bringing all the city states under her control. There are The Crimson Guards, The Bridgburners, The Claw, The Tiste Andii, The T'lan Imass, and The Barghast to name a few of the military organizations and different cultures involved in this conflict. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://s1183.photobucket.com/albums/x462/jkeeten/?action=view\u0026amp;current=Bridgeburners.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003e\n  \u003cimg src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1380376048i/730767.jpg\" alt=\"Photobucket\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\"\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDid I mention this is an epic fantasy series? Is there magic you might ask? The air is absolutely nose twitching foul with the smell of casting spells. There are warrens that zip those of a magical aptitude from one end of the country to the other. There are mages, there are gods (bunch of ninnies), there are evil cast off creatures that are slumbering waiting for a chance to enslave the world, there are hell hounds, there are enchanted sword blades, magical coins, possessed marionettes, and assassins. I know, I know if I were reading this I would be thinking not for me. I'm not a Dungeons and Dragons kind of guy. I don't play video games. I don't as a rule read fantasy books. I absolutely \u003cb\u003eLOVED\u003c/b\u003e this book; in fact, I loved it so much I think I may have been hit with a book love potion spell, so keep that in mind when you think about adding this to your reading list. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI've read the reviews, and one of the main points of concern to those that did not like this book is the massive, record breaking number of characters that are thrown at you. It is true. It is as if you have went over to Steven Erikson's house and there he is with his group of geeky (to not type cast they could be employed people too) buddies and they have been engrossed in this role playing game for the last 10 years with evolving rules and characters and you are dropped right in the middle of their latest epic struggle expected to assimilated ten years of evolution in ten minutes. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor the first few chapters my brain was reeling like a drunken sailor on leave in Shanghai. After I realized that I was drunk, I did what I always do when I find myself in such precarious circumstances. I relaxed and let Erickson's world flow over me, around me, through me, in me until suddenly everything starting clicking into place. For whatever reason Erickson with a few descriptive sentences locked characters into my head, so even when they disappeared for twenty chapters I could still remember who they were when they became crucial to the plot again. This could all be a residual symptom of the book love potion as well. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI think another problem that might occur for readers is to read a bit and leave it for a week. I could see how threads of the plot would become tangled or lost and the frustration for the reader would increase exponentially. It is a book that might be assumed to be a light pleasure read and that would be a big mistake. I read this book every day until I finished it. Family must be attended to. Work was an irritation that had to be endured, but these imposed absences heightened my pleasure once I escaped back to the Book of the Fallen . \u003cb\u003eI had to find out what happened to Tattersail.\u003c/b\u003e Like the Mazalan Empire there is no way to be neutral on this book. You will either love it or absolutely \u003cs\u003ehate\u003c/s\u003e adore \u003cs\u003edespise\u003c/s\u003e relish it.
