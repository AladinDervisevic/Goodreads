You can't post that on Goodreads. <br><br>Me: *glares* Why not? <br><br>A voice in my head (aka VH): Please, don't. You will ruin your reputation. <br><br>Me: *weary* Not that again. <br><br>VH: Well, it's true. You can't post that. It's just not okay. Do you have any idea how popular this book is? Hint : YOU CAN'T EVEN GUESS.<br><br>Me: Why should I care? Maybe some people think like me.<br><br>VH: You don't understand. It's not just random book that you can critize like you do all the time and just get away with it. This is THE FAULT IN OUR STARS. And it's <i>John Green</i>. Believe me, you do NOT want to get in the way of those crazy fans, nerdfighters or whatever it is they call themselves. <br><br>Me: Really, what the fuck do I care? I want to give this 3 stars. It's not like I'm giving it 1 star or something. <br><br>VH: But why would you even do that in the first place? EVERYONE, and I do mean EVERYONE in your friend list gave it 5 stars. And they used so many sobbing gifs! Really, it made me cry a little just looking at them. <br><br>Me: *stares*<br><br>VH: It won the Goodreads award for best YA!<br><br>Me: So? Fifty Shades won Best Romance. <br><br>VH: It's got one of the highest general ratings for a book on Goodreads!<br><br>Me: Nobody but the Goodreads community actually cares. And wait. I'm not even sure the Goodreads community actually cares. I know I don't.<br><br>VH: You're such a cold-hearted bitch. Why would you give it only 3 stars anyway? Don't you have a heart? And why 3 stars? I know you really loved the book, deep down! <br><br>Me: I didn't. I mean, I liked it, it was okay... but I didn't love it. It's... I mean... Oh, fuck it. It's overrated. There! I said it. Sue me. <br><br>VH: *seethes* You did NOT just say that. <br><br>Me : I did. Because it is! Come on, did you read the dialogues in this? Can we talk about the dialogues? I want to talk about the dialogues.<br><br>VH: *crosses arms* Go ahead. I want examples.<br><br>Me: Fine. I'll start with the popular quotes. You know what I'm talking about. The quotes which are totally overrated and everyone loves them and they create pics and stuff when really, if you think about the quote in itself.. Well, you realize that it just, you know, sucks. <br><br>VH: *mumbles* How 'bout: you suck?<br><br>Me: What was that? Actually, forget it, I don't give a shit. Listen to this! <blockquote>“My thoughts are stars I cannot fathom into constellations.”</blockquote>
<br>VH: So? It's beautiful.<br><br>Me: Well...*tries really hard to refrain from laughing* I mean... Seriously? Like... *fails miserably* HAHAHAHA how more pretentious can you get? Comparing your <i>thoughts</i> to stars? REALLY?<br><br>VH: You're so shallow. Some of us have deep thoughts, you know. Like, thoughts so deep they actually deserve to be compared to the firmament. I don't even want to explain to you how poetic this is, because I'd waste my time. <br><br>Me: Save yourself the effort, I don't mind. And I've got another example. Probably my favorite.<br><blockquote>"That's the thing about pain. It demands to be felt."</blockquote>
<br>VH: What now? You're gonna say that it's so pretentious it made you cry?<br><br>Me: Precisely. *nods wisely* Because that's the thing about tears. They demand to be wet. Or that's the thing about food. It demands to be eaten. Or that's the thing about...<br><br>VH: SHUT UP, I get it! There's no discussion with you. How am I supposed to discuss with someone who's got the intellectual depth of an empty oyster?<br><br>Me: But come on, I'm not finished yet. What about Augustus and his unlit cigarette?<br><blockquote>“They don’t kill you unless you light them,” he said. “And I’ve never lit one. It’s a metaphor, see: You put the killing thing right between your teeth, but you don’t give it the power to do its killing.”</blockquote>
<br>Me: Is this supposed to be smart? This is pathetic. It's terrible, it's not funny, and it's not deep. <br><br>VH: *hisses* It's a metaphor!<br><br>Me: I know!<br><blockquote>“It’s a metaphor,” I said, dubious. <br>“It’s a metaphor,” he said.<br>“You choose your behaviors based on their metaphorical resonances...” I said.<br>“Oh, yes.” He smiled. “I’m a big believer in metaphor, Hazel Grace.”</blockquote>
<br>Me: Can you say metaphor again? Say metaphor one more time! Go ahead, say it, I think John Green hasn't totally forced it down my throat yet! *hysterical yelling* LET'S SAY IT AGAIN! Metaphor! Everything is a <i>METAPHOR</i>!<br><br>VH: What's your point, you freak?<br><br>Me: My point is, the dialogues are horrible. It made my eyes burn. It's pretentious and unbelievable, AND besides, you can totally see that John Green loves the characters.<br><br>VH: What author doesn't like the characters of their own book?<br><br>Me: It's not the same! With John Green... It's like he adores himself. I bet you anything he re-reads his own books. Just to see exactly how <i>awesome</i> they are. <br><br>VH: What? You don't know that. You cannot possibly say that. How dare you talk about him like you know him.<br><br>Me: You know, in the audio version of The Fault in Our Stars, at the end, there's an interview with him. And he explicitly says that he just LOVES listening to the audio versions of his books. So there.<br><br>VH: What? No. You're wrong. He doesn't mean, like, he loves it when someone reads him his own books. That's not what he meant AT ALL. It's a misunderstanding. What he meant was, he loves listening to the.. the.. <i>reading lady</i>. Because she has <i>such</i> a sweet voice and everything. <br><br>Me: Are you kidding me? He's in love with himself! Augustus is just an hologram. An empty shell. Seriously, his monologues are laughable. I couldn't even focus. I kept thinking of John Green while reading. Because Augustus is just SO witty, so smart, so perfect. *cough cough* <s>wish fulfillment hello</s>.<br><br>VH: I am so not convinced.<br><br>Me: There's this whole repetition thing, too. I cannot believe how all the characters of his books look alike. How come it works every SINGLE time? How many books are out there, now? 4? 5? More, surely. It's always the SAME THING. Geeky and nerdy narrator, geekier and nerdier sidekick, mysterious but unbelievable girl, random plot that doesn't even make sense, road trip. Come the fuck on. You know what? The fact that people aren't getting tired of him and his stupid same characters is the real question.<br><br>VH: But this book is unique. The way it deals with cancer and death... It's so beautiful. You cannot possibly say it isn't.<br><br>Me: That's what disturbed me the most. Look. What I want to say is, not every death is glorious. Not every death is epic and not every death will glow like a star in the eternal twilight sky. Most of the time, deaths are random, plain, and the world is cold and uncaring, and that's how it is. And that's what's terrible. You don't need to be a hero, you don't need to defy death the way Augustus pretends to, you don't need to lose yourself in unbelievable speeches to have people cry over your death. The book is just TOO much. <br><br>VH: You know, about them being unbelievable when they talk? You seem to forget something. Augustus and Hazel ARE different. They're unique, so they talk different. That's what it's all about.<br><br>Me: They're not different, they don't exist. They <i>can't</i> exist. Honestly? I don't think this was a good tribute to the kids who are really sick. Because no one talks like that, NO ONE, and I feel like now there's this messed-up hierarchy between the sick kids who are sort of smart ass and those who aren't. And I refuse that. I can't accept that. <b>Being ironic, jaded, detached and all metaphorical over the disease is a luxury that genuinely sick teenagers cannot afford.</b> So fuck this. And I'd rather kneel before a kid who has cancer and who doesn't know what a metaphor is than shed a tear over one of Augustus's stupid monologues.<br><br>VH: You liar, I know you cried while you read the book. You were a sobbing mess.<br><br>Me: I wasn't. I was a sobbing mess at the end of <a href="https://goodreads.com/book/show/1314332.Before_I_Die" title="Before I Die by Jenny Downham" rel="noopener">Before I Die</a>. And oh my God, I couldn't even speak after I finished <a href="https://goodreads.com/book/show/8621462.A_Monster_Calls" title="A Monster Calls by Patrick Ness" rel="noopener">A Monster Calls</a> because I was crying so hard. <a href="https://goodreads.com/book/show/12700353.Me_and_Earl_and_the_Dying_Girl" title="Me and Earl and the Dying Girl by Jesse Andrews" rel="noopener">Me and Earl and the Dying Girl</a> had me in tears, too. These are all gorgeous books that deal with cancer. And I cried <s>like a bitch</s> every single time, and they broke my heart. But this? I didn't cry.<br><br>VH: You did, and you know it. Especially at THIS special moment.<br><br>Me: *looks away* I don't know what you're talking about.<br><br>VH : You cried when Hazel asked her mom if she would still be a mom after her death.<br><br>Me: Fine, okay. I cried. I know. Okay? I know. But look. That's precisely the point. That's what I call emotional blackmail. Because I DARE YOU not to cry over that discussion. Because it's a universal fear! Whether you're a mom, or a daughter, or both, if you have a sister even, you must have thought about that already and told yourself : Okay, if I die, or if she dies. Who will I be? If my sister dies and I'm asked whether I have a sibling, what should I say? Am I still a sister because she existed, once? Or if you have a child, and then one day your baby dies. What happens then? Are you still a parent? Are you still a parent because once, you <i>used to</i> be a parent, and because there's a room upstairs that <i>used</i> to be your child's? I dare you to think about it and not end up crying. I took it as a betrayal from John Green because I feel like he didn't play fair. OF COURSE talking about a child's death in this peculiar way will make the reader cry! But it's so easy. It doesn't require any talent. Just ask anyone to talk about that and they'll be tearing up in 5 seconds! Do you understand what I'm trying to say? I feel like he was like, "I'm gonna make them cry." and all the while I was reading I swear I could hear him: "ARE YOU SAD YET? ARE YOU HEARTBROKEN YET? DO YOU SEE HOW INCREDIBLY UPSETTING MY STORY IS? I KNOW, RIGHT. I AMAZE MYSELF SOMETIMES."<br><br>VH: But--<br><br>Me: No, look. Writing like that, it's not incredible, it's not magical and it's not valuable. It's playing with people's weaknesses. It's manipulating people into crying. And I can't respect him with that the way I respect people who manage to make me cry without using such poor plot devices. Like in, <a href="https://goodreads.com/book/show/12700353.Me_and_Earl_and_the_Dying_Girl" title="Me and Earl and the Dying Girl by Jesse Andrews" rel="noopener">Me and Earl and The Dying Girl</a>. There's a cancer book that really took me by surprise. Because, Rachel, the sick girl, is everything but admirable. She's young, a bit shallow, nice, shy, plain, normal, really. And her neighbor who befriends her, he doesn't fall in love with her. And her death won't be remembered like something that scarred humanity, because it didn't. Ultimately, it didn't even matter at all. And I could relate more easily to that, to the meaningless dimension of her death, to the emptiness of it all, more than I could ever relate to the ridiculous speeches of Augustus (and Hazel's too, for that matter). Because you know what bothered me, too? They're indistinct. <br><br>VH: That's because they're soul mates. That's the whole point of the book. They found themselves in each other.<br><br>Me: It doesn't work to say they're soul mates. Look, I read the book almost a year ago, I think. And this:<br><blockquote>“I’m in love with you, and I’m not in the business of denying myself the simple pleasure of saying true things. I’m in love with you, and I know that love is just a shout into the void, and that oblivion is inevitable, and that we’re all doomed and that there will come a day when all our labor has been returned to dust, and I know the sun will swallow the only earth we’ll ever have, and I am in love with you.”</blockquote>
<br>Me: This is beautiful, granted. It's also unrealistic that a teenager would ever say that, let alone improvize it, but whatever, it's pretty. But the thing is, I am completely unable to say whether it's Augustus or Hazel who says that. I don't know. I have no idea. I try to recognize the style, but I can't tell, BECAUSE THEY TALK EXACTLY THE SAME.<br><br>VH: ...<br><br>Me: So yeah. I didn't love the book, and I am not in the business of denying myself the simple pleasure of saying true things; I didn't love the book, and I know this review might be just a shout into the void, and that oblivion is inevitable, and that we're all doomed to another John Green book about an unbelievable loser <s>and his even more loser sidekick</s> loving an unbelievable teenage girl, and that there will come a day when maybe he will change his writing formula, and maybe that'll come when the sun will swallow the only earth we'll ever have, but then it'll be too late, so who cares? I didn't love this book.<br><br>VH: *suspiciously silent*<br><br>Me: Are we done?<br><br>VH: FINE. Ugh. Okay. *Waves white flag* I surrender.<br><br>Me: Yes! *clicks "save

  <b>Update (25/06/2014)-</b>
</u><br>Since I've been receiving a lot of cyber bullies and hate messages, I’m going to clarify few things.<br><br>-Firstly, this is a negative review of the book and it has got a lot of potential to infuriate the fans. If you think that your opinion is the only opinion that exists on earth and that no one should dislike your favourite book, then I would suggest you to avoid this review.<br><br>-<b>Stop harassing me</b>. Why can't you get it through your thick skulls that everyone has different opinions, they’re going to interpret books differently from you and stop being selfish to think that just because you loved a book that means the whole world should love it. This world is full of people with differing opinions, differing thoughts and differing likes and differing dislikes, learn to respect them even if you don’t agree with what they have to say about your favourite books. Just because you love a particular book that I hate doesn't make you a good person and me a bad person, It simply shows that people like different things. <br><br>Every reader has the freedom to dissect and critically analyse any book and write their thoughts on it in their own review space without the fear of anyone (or fans bossing them into writing what the fandom wants). Critically analysing books and criticising problematic aspects of any reading material prevents people from being passive readers.<b>Shakespeare and J.K Rowling too have their own share of critics then what makes Green’s book flawless that it’s not allowed to be criticised?</b> <br><br>-<b>Stop cyber bullying and trolling me.</b> Your hate messages and death threats will show much more of your personality than your love for this book. Remember, every time you comment any bullshit here, you’re giving your own fandom a bad name and my review more popularity. Also, your hate messages aren't going to put me down. I’m a strong girl and I’m always going to stand up for what I believe in come hell or high water. I don't fear anyone and no one can ever force me to follow their orders like a puppet especially not a fandom where <b>most</b> of the fans are immature cyber bullies who can’t respect other’s opinions. Also, I've caught fans making fake accounts to troll my review, this shows me that they are big cowards who hide their faces and send me spiteful comments.<br><br>-Lastly, I’m NOT shaming anyone for loving this book. You can love whatever you want to and believe in whomever you want to. I have no problem with people who genuinely love this book;<b> I have problems with those who think readers should not have the rights to express their dislike for any book, I have problems with those who approve of and participate in cyber bullying reviewers who write negative reviews on their favourite books, I have problems with those who refuse to acknowledge the fact that their favourite books can have flaws and not everyone’s going to love them, I have problems with those who come here to shove their opinions down my throat. Do you find anyone who hated this book shoving their opinions in comments of positive reviews? Then what makes you think that you have the rights to troll negative reviews?</b><br><br>Alright, now let's begin with the review.<br><b>
  <u>**WARNING- MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD**</u>
</b>	<br><br><b>EXPECTATION-</b><br><br><img src="https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1380222758ra/627831.gif" class="gr-hostedUserImg" loading="lazy"><br><br><img src="https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1380387347ra/747345.gif" class="gr-hostedUserImg" loading="lazy"><br><br><img src="https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1380387347ra/747346.gif" class="gr-hostedUserImg" loading="lazy"><br><br><b>REALITY-</b><br><img src="https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1380387347ra/747347.gif" class="gr-hostedUserImg" loading="lazy"><br><br><img src="https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1380222758ra/625186.gif" class="gr-hostedUserImg" loading="lazy"><br><br><img src="https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1382292005ra/5792188.gif" class="gr-hostedUserImg" loading="lazy"><br><br>So I happily bought the hardcover of The Fault in our stars back in December 2012 after seeing the high average GR ratings and raving reviews saying how beautiful, life-changing, thought-provoking and blah blah it is. Surprisingly, this book was so <i>special</i> that it became the first book that I slammed on the wall twice after reading it. It didn’t only disappoint me but also angered me. I'm surprised to find that harsh critics are swallowing up this trash and calling it a masterpiece. Ugh! <br><br>I’m going to make a list of everything I hate about this book that earned it the topmost place on my list of <b>Worst books ever.</b><br><br><u>
  <b>The characters-</b>
</u> Hazel and Augustus are the flattest cardboard cut-outs I have ever seen in any book. Both of them were like 60-years-old stuck in some teenager's bodies making them very boring and unlikable. Hazel was such an annoying, stupid and pretentious Mary Sue that I wanted to punch her right in the face. One great example of her stupidity-<br><br><i>”Why are breakfast foods breakfast foods...Like, why don’t we have curry for breakfast?”<br><br>"A nonhot boy stares at you relentlessly and it is, at best, awkward and, at worst, a form of assault.<br>But a hot boy . . . well."</i> <br><br>Augustus and Hazel have the same boring, pretentious, know-it-all and indistinguishable personality. Hazel is the female version of Augustus (no, I’m not going to call him affectionately with Gus) and he is the male version of Hazel. These two characters meld together and have no depth at all. I couldn’t connect with them, I felt no pain and sympathy for them and they annoyed me so much that I wanted to stab them.<br> <br><u>
  <b>Romance-</b>
</u> It fell from the sky. Seriously, I don’t get what’s so “beautiful” about the relationship between them. They both fall in love within seconds just after laying eyes on each other <b>
  <i>~love at first sight~</i>
</b>. The romance is undeveloped and it comes from nowhere. I was baffled when Hazel accepted to go to Augustus's house just minutes after meeting him. WHAT THE HELL? How stupid can you be? You fall for a guy's words whom you met just few minutes ago and agree to go to his house! <b>What if he were a murderer or rapist?</b> <br><br>Not to mention that the kissing scene in Anne Frank's house was so effing disgusting. Anne Frank's house is considered to be a place of remembrance, a place where 2 families hid during the dark days of Holocaust. If anyone makes out at such a revered site, they would be kicked out regardless of who or what they are. People present around will be disgusted, they won't stand and watch much less clap for the "lovely" couple.<br><br><u>
  <b>Writing-</b>
</u> Cheesy. Emotionless. Terrible. Want to hear some <i>favourite</i> quotes of mine? <br><br><i>“My thoughts are stars I cannot fathom into constellations.”</i>...Why compare your thoughts to stars and constellations? *sighs*<br><br><i>"Some infinities are bigger than other infinities."</i><br><br><img src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1394461747i/8855771.jpg" class="gr-hostedUserImg" loading="lazy"><br><br><i> "That's the thing about pain. It demands to be felt."</i>...Yeah, that’s the thing about chocolate, it demands to be eaten.<br><br><i> ”I'm in love with you, and I'm not in the business of denying myself the simple pleasure of saying true things. I'm in love with you, and I know that love is just a shout into the void, and that oblivion is inevitable, and that we're all doomed and that there will come a day when all our labor has been returned to dust, and I know the sun will swallow the only earth we'll ever have, and I am in love with you.”</i> <br><br><input type="checkbox" class="spoiler__control" aria-label="The following text has been marked spoiler.

I’ll stop here because just thinking about them gives me an awful migraine. <br><br>And you know what? <b>Teenagers living in the 21st century DON'T speak like that. No teen can spontaneously come up with long monologues within seconds. Also, genuinely sick teenagers don’t have the luxury to be so witty and clever every single time. One thing I don't buy is that teens with cancer suddenly become magically wise. They become terrified, confused, depressed and angry. They DON’T magically gain great insight in life and go around puking long monologues about the meaning of life.</b> This book made me roll my eyes in disgust. <br><br><b>
  <i>(UPDATE- In response to gazillion questions and arguments I've been getting on the paragraphs above, I have written a detailed explanation below)***</i>
</b><br><br><b>
  <u>Plot-</u>
</b> Predictable. Boring. Uninspiring. Put me to sleep. I had to plough through the whole book. Cancer is hard, it's painful but this book didn’t show me that. I couldn’t feel Hazel and Augustus’ struggle against it. I couldn’t feel their pain. TFioS is nothing but a cheesy romance novel.<br><br>Me throughout the book-<br><br><img src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1390650130i/8257203.png" class="gr-hostedUserImg" loading="lazy"><br><br><i>"He died eight days after his prefuneral"</i><br>WHAT THE HELL?? Green tried to make his death sound LIKE HE WENT TO A PARTY LAST WEEK!!!<br><br>Ok, so this book made you cry, right? If a book makes you cry it doesn’t mean that it’s a masterpiece. I can understand that you must’ve felt sad and sympathetic for the characters and must’ve cried but considering that this novel is sad and it made you cry doesn’t make it an awesome, life-changing and beautiful story. I cried after reading Allegiant for days but I hated that book with burning passion, it was one of the worst books I ever read. <br><br>Before you start calling me a cold-hearted bitch for hating and criticising this book, let me tell you that if you think you have every right to go around fangirling how wonderful this book was then I believe that I have every right to express my hatred for it whether you like it or not.<br><br><b>***</b> I never mentioned or implied that teenagers are illiterate or can't have a large vocabulary, don't accuse me of something I haven't said. I just find it hard to believe that any teen can come up with nonsensical monologues like the ones below or think it's appropriate to use them in their conversations-<br><br><i>"I’m awash in the metaphorical resonance of the empty playground in the hospital courtyard” <br>“That kid never took a piss without pondering the abundant metaphysical resonances of human waste production”.</i> (wtf?!)<br><br>It's hard to believe that anyone would talk like that in a normal conversation every single time.<br>I am a teen and I go to high school, I know many other teens of my age who have developed a large vocabulary and have brilliant writing skills. That is simply because they love reading and have developed the habit of learning new words from the dictionary from a very young age. They write amazing poems and honestly, it takes them a lot of time to ponder over and make their metaphors or poems perfect. They obviously cannot open their mouth and spontaneously say<br><i>"My thoughts are stars I cannot fathom into constellations".</i><br><br>Btw, none of the teenage characters from this book show any interest in reading high literature and poetry (the only book Hazel claims to read is <i>An Imperial Affliction</i>) then what's the reason behind their ability to spew pretentious monologues? <b>They aren't geniuses, they aren't teens who read avidly or analyse high literature and show interest in oratory, existentialist philosophy and poetry. Therefore, it's not plausible for them to speak with profound words.</b> I would believe their monologues had they shown interest in Kant, Sartre, Nietzsche and Heidegger.<br><br>Now going over the cigarette metaphor, Augustus buys a pack of cigarettes regularly just so he could put one in his mouth and not light it thus, giving us another stupid dialogue "It's a metaphor. You keep the killing thing between your teeth but don't give it the power to kill you". Funny that he won't kill himself by lighting up the cigarette but will regularly give money to an industry that is the largest cause of cancer thus, promoting the cigarette industry and indirectly killing others. (What a genius!) Not to mention that he mocks Hazel's cancer right on her face and guess her reaction? She's impressed and readily approves of and participants in his metaphor.<br><br>There's a lot of difference between being wise and being pretentious and Hazel and Augustus are the latter. I don't buy their dialogues because they are extremely ridiculous and cheesy and no argument by fans and authors can change my opinion because Green makes no effort in making the dialogues IN THE BOOK seem plausible. There's no reason for their large vocabulary and ability to spew long monologues IN THE BOOK. I've read Green's post on Augustus' character being pretentious and imo, he misses the point that his characters are not only pretentious; they are extremely unrealistic as well. Augustus' pretension is not "an intentional flaw", it's simply poor characterisation.<br><br>I'm not saying that kids with cancer cannot be intelligent. A lot of fans say that the characters in the book are special and wise because they have cancer and this book tries hard to show that too. I merely said that having cancer does not mean that you can automatically become wise and gain a lot of knowledge. <br><br>I couldn't sympathise with the characters and feel their pain. That doesn't mean that I'm cold hearted. <b>It's not my fault that I couldn't get emotionally connected to the characters, it's the authors fault for not writing characters I could sympathise with. It's the author's fault for making shallow, judgemental and annoying characters. It's the his fault for making characters with personality that mocks cancer patients and who show disrespect to millions of people who died in the Holocaust. It's the author's fault for romanticising cancer and using it as a ploy to sell his book.</b> I'm NOT hating people who have cancer, I'm NOT hating the characters because they have cancer. I'm hating them for who they are. I'm hating the book because it's poorly written. <br><br>I don't need to have cancer to analyse this book. Having cancer does not mean that you get the rights to say whatever you want to about this book. Every reader whether sick or not has equal rights to analyse and voice their opinions freely on any book. <br><br><b>/end

gotten to the point where my sister and I have inside jokes on how stupid and shallow this book is. I can't think about this book without getting angry.<br><br>I have a history with pretentious people.<br>My biggest mess involved two boys in particular who were so incredibly full of themselves that for the first time in my life, I openly expressed my dislike to them. They know that I couldn’t care less about their “hotness” or just how amazing they were. So goddamn full of themselves, spoiled rotten, just overall horrible people.<br><br>In short, my personality clashes with theirs entirely and there really is no chance of a friendship. I’d dive into it, but then this wouldn’t be a book review.<br><br>And so I move on.<br><br><i>The Fault in Our Stars</i> is my first John Green book.<br><br>Yeah, I know, but I didn’t really get into reading up until maybe four years ago. And I’m not too into contemporary, but the opportunity presented itself and I took my first dive. My sister is a fan of John Green. She really loves <i>Looking for Alaska</i> and <i>Will Grayson, Will Grayson</i> and finds <i>Paper Towns</i> to be LfA’s quirky New Girl twin that doesn’t own up.<br><br>I almost feel bad for disliking this book, but that’s strictly on the idea of cancer. Cancer is horrible, unpredictable, and the worst part is that it’s your own cells mutating against you. That’s why it’s so hard to defeat. That’s what I wish this book was about: dealing with the cancer that wants to kill you. Instead, I get a book about a fictional miracle drug that keeps Hazel alive so she can have a boy love her <input type="checkbox" class="spoiler__control" aria-label="The following text has been marked spoiler.

But I ended up really wanting to put the book down several times. From the first few pages, I felt something was actually wrong. Like I didn’t know what I was getting myself into. Having finished this book, which, to me, was such a chore to do, I think I’ve stumbled upon decent reasons as to why I really can’t give this any more than two stars.<br><br>If you didn’t know by now, <i>The Fault in Our Stars</i> tells the story of Hazel, a girl whose thyroid cancer has ceased to grow thanks to a magical miracle drug. But because her cancer life is just so boring, a boy has to make it better.<br>Because that is the only way anything gets better in life.<br>Boyz.<br><br><b>Cancer People, Dear Readers</b><br><br><u>WRITING</u><br><br>This was by far the largest problem I had. Larger than Hazel saying, “I wanna tap that” about Augustus on page 8. This prose was not the voice of a real teenager. It tried, but this did not sound like a teenager suffering from cancer. This was the voice of a teenager who liked to say, “You know what sucks? Cancer. You know what else sucks? Dying.” Why? So the reader could laugh.<br><br>And wouldn’t you know it <b>every line is like that</b>. There is no rest for any real emotion or interest. It’s all laced with some one-liner or trying to be hilariously philosophical when it’s just trying way too hard to keep a reader interested. And this alone, made me find great distaste in the character of Hazel. <br><br>She is not believable because I never learned anything about her. She just hates Support Group and adores Augustus for reasons that were never clarified throughout the book. Oh you like Gus’s smile, his laugh? The idea that he thinks of basketball really as a nod to a baby toy? The idea that he spends money just so he can conduct a metaphor that doesn’t do anything but make him look like a pretentious asshole?<br><br>Oh who am I kidding. This entire book was shallow and pretentious. Everyone thought they were so hilarious because did you know that eggs are restricted to a breakfast food? Those poor scrambled eggs! <b>No, I don’t give a flying fuck about scrambled eggs and their apparent oppression</b>. But think about it! We only have eggs for breakfast! <b>Because you choose to point it out as such.</b><br><br>Or get this, how about the hurdles event in track? You know what Augustus says about hurdles? He says this after that beautiful basketball connection to a child shoving cylinders into circle holes:<br><br>“<i>And I wondered if the hurdlers ever thought, you know, ‘This would go faster if they just got rid of the hurdles.’”</i><br><br><img src="https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1380402745ra/783018.gif" alt="Image and video hosting by TinyPic" class="gr-hostedUserImg" loading="lazy"><br><br><b>THIS IS ONE OF THE STUPIDEST THINGS I HAVE EVER READ IN A BOOK.</b><br><br>Augustus Waters, <i>actual athlete</i>, says something like this about a sport. Sports are a very healthy way to escape stress. If anything, Augustus and his philosophical ass should be wondering what the hurdles represent to the hurdlers. HURDLES ARE A SPECIAL EVENT. The hurdlers are probably doing a running event too! They CHOSE to run the hurdles for the challenge.<br><br>But this falls on the level of those scrambled eggs. Hey! If we talk about this and make it sound funny, it’ll be deep! It’ll really scratch the heads of the readers! This just shows how silly and thoughtful Augustus is! Don’t you guys just want to get with him and his awesome cigarette metaphor that HE SPENDS MONEY ON FOR NO FUCKING REASON?<br><br>Guh, you fucking stupid ignorant son of a bitch. This was the line, by the way, that got me in that level of dislike for Augustus that I got on with the asshole dudes that exist in my life. And Hazel just sort of accepts this. Like, what the hell is everyone thinking in this book? What universe are they in? Because this is not a real universe.<br><br><img src="https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1380402745ra/783019.gif" alt="Image and video hosting by TinyPic" class="gr-hostedUserImg" loading="lazy"><br><br>I think now I’m tracking into character territory so here:<br><br><u>CHARACTERS</u><br><br>Hazel was the girl who referred to testicular cancer as “cancer to the balls” and then she sees Augustus Waters on page 8 of this book and goes, <br><br>“<i>Look, let me just say it: He was hot. A nonhot boy stares at you relentlessly and it is, at best, awkward and, at worst, a form of assault. But a hot boy…well</i>”<br><br><img src="https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1380402745ra/783020.gif" alt="Image and video hosting by TinyPic" class="gr-hostedUserImg" loading="lazy"><br><br>Remember, if you’re not drop dead gorgeous, men, your nice glances are only awkward. That’s it. You can never go farther, and your delicious insight on life will never win the heart of a girl. Because you are just not sexy enough or Augustinian for it. Hazel likes to do this. She likes to put down other guys for her Gus, even though they still BARELY knew each other.<br><br><i>I met Kaitlyn and her (cute but frankly not Augustinian) boyfriend for coffee one afternoon.</i><br><br>LOOK AT THAT. What. What is that? This was a nice guy and Hazel’s like, “Well he’s not a fucking Greek God so no thank you.” But what about Augustus, Hazel? You went to his house to watch a movie that you decided was just a silly boy movie that you knew you wouldn’t like because you were a girl. MOVIES DON’T WORK LIKE THAT. What are you even doing!<br><br>You know what I just realized? Hazel is a lot like Mary in The Forest of Hands and Teeth. She hates one thing and loves only one material thing. Hazel hates the cancer support group, and loves <i>An Imperial Affliction</i>. Mary hates the Unconsecrated, but loves the ocean. That’s all they have to their name. Which is AMAZING to me that Augustus finds something to love about Hazel. All it is is her John Green wit.<br><br>If you asked Gus what else was there to Hazel besides this one book thing and her wit, I bet you a hundred dollars that he would respond as Derek in <i>Swan Princess</i> did with “What else is there?”<br><br>Because that’s all their love is. They’re not bonding over the fact they have cancer. They bonded over <i>An Imperial Affliction</i> then experienced an intensified Hey Arnold! Episode about visiting the author who, to no one’s surprise I hope, was a complete jackass then makes a 180 because…because. Who needs reasons.<br><br>HOWEVER, the half star is devoted to Mr. Peter Van Houten, who was the only actual character in this book. Everyone else was flat and pretentious assholes. When Van Houten did it, there was history behind it and a REASON. He actually had an arc! He did things! Despite my lack of care for Augustus and Hazel, the way Peter treated them was abhorring and the only way for me to fix that was to stab the man in the eye. But he changed, and revealed WHY he acted the way he did and there was sense made and he was a good character.<br><br><u>STRUCTURE</u><br><br>Structure was fine.<br>Still flowed okay despite my need to be done with this.<br><br><u>OVERALL</u><br><br>I honestly thought everything was funny. I laugh at a loooooot of stuff. This, whatever this is, is not really that funny. It’s shallow, and not really geared to people who want to know the world of cancer and stepping over the obstacle. It’s a cancer-filled girl loving <input type="checkbox" class="spoiler__control" aria-label="The following text has been marked spoiler.

Oh and they meet their favorite author who’s actually an asshole. Cancer is the backseat, and I almost find it insulting.<br><br>I don’t understand why people love this. Tell me all you want that Augustus is a beautiful boy and Hazel just wanted something different in her life, but don’t you DARE tell me that this is deep. This is not a deep book, there’s nothing that touches my heart except shallow wit and a poor man suffering from the cancerous death of his 8 year-old ray of sunshine.<br><br>I could go on, but I think this is enough. If it isn’t, well that’s your opinion. This is mine. You are just gonna have to deal.<br><br>Final Remarks:<br><br>This book should have been about what happened to Peter Van Houten.<br>It’d be perfectly parallel to that Hey Arnold! episode I mentioned, but it’d be better than what I read.<br><br>OR, this book should have been about Hazel WITH THE TERMINAL CANCER. Because her inner conflict with cancer would better clash with her ability to be with Augustus and it would've fleshed her out a hell of a lot more than giving her a magical miracle drug.<br></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></["br"]></span></div></div></div></section></section><section

class="ReviewText"><section class="ReviewText__content"><div class="TruncatedText"><div class="TruncatedText__text TruncatedText__text--5" data-testid="contentContainer"><div><span class="Formatted">At age twenty-two, John Green worked as a student chaplain in a children's hospital. <br /><br />Let's take a moment and consider all the implications of that, and why he is making a colossal understatement when he described the experience as "devastating." That was about twelve years ago, and Green has said in interviews that because of this experience, he's spent twelve years trying to write a book about kids with cancer - not poster children of strength and courage and illness-granted wisdom, but real kids and their families and friends who have to cope with the fact that they will die young. <br /><br />All novels are personal, but Green's novels seem, to me, to be especially so. But this one is personal in a different way. With this novel, Green isn't trying to exorcize the memory of <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/107137255" rel="nofollow noopener">the girl</a> who <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/95559975" rel="nofollow noopener">stomped on his heart</a> in <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/93836698" rel="nofollow noopener">high school</a>. This goes deeper than high school romance and Manic Pixie Dream Girl angst. This is about life, death, illness, love, heroism, and how a sixteen-year-old is supposed to deal with the fact that she will die and leave everyone she loves behind. Maybe it's just because I've been watching vlogbrothers videos for four years and feel like I'm actually acquainted with John Green, but this is the most deeply personal novel I've ever read. <br /><br />This is not, as Hazel Lancaster might say, a Cancer Book. None of the cancer patients in this story have a wisdom beyond their years, and they do not stoically accept the fact that they will die or fight heroically. Hazel Lancaster, a terminal sixteen-year-old who has to carry an oxygen tank everywhere because "my lungs suck at being lungs" is refreshingly real - not manic, not a pixie, not a dream girl. She reads Great Books and watches <i>America's Next Top Model</i> marathons. Augustus Waters, her amputee friend, wants desperately to leave a lasting impression on the world and philosophizes about heroism, and his favorite book is a novelization of a video game. (can I say how much I love that an author can establish a character's intelligence without telling us that they love reading Austen <i>yes Stephenie Meyer I'm looking at you</i>) Everything here is real, especially the diseases. There isn't any bullshit about dying gracefully here, because cancer is <i>ugly</i> and unpleasant, and Green makes you feel Hazel's lungs struggling to breathe and the pain, and see the vomit and urine. (Remember how in <i>A Walk to Remember</i>, Mandy Moore has been secretly dying of leukemia the whole time but looks great even on her deathbed? Nicholas Sparks can fuck right off for that insult to real cancer patients) Most importantly, Hazel and Augustus are not defined by their cancer. It consumes their lives, but it doesn't define them. On every page, it's clear: this is a story told by someone who hasn't known just one person with cancer, but has seen a multitude of children with terminal diseases, and has tried to find some way to comfort them and their families. <br /><br />It's for that reason that I don't feel like I can review this like a normal book. John Green didn't write this story for me, and so I don't feel like I have any place saying that it's amazing and beautiful and heartbreaking. And I certainly can't criticize any of its minor faults. All I can say, really, is that you have to read this for yourself, and go from there. <br /><br />...<br /><br />Okay, you guys know me better than that. I have one big complaint, which I will describe here, and all I ask is that you remember that I still gave this five stars. <br /><br />Augustus Waters, in the first few chapters, comes off as a pretentious douche. When Hazel first meets him at a cancer support group, they're talking afterwards and Augustus takes out a cigarette and puts it in his mouth. Hazel, who you'll recall is dying because her lungs cannot function, freaks out: "...even though you HAD FREAKING CANCER you give money to a company in exchange for the chance to acquire YET MORE CANCER." Augustus explains that he doesn't smoke the cigarettes, he just puts them in his mouth (no, really) because "They don't kill you unless you light them...And I've never lit one. It's a metaphor, see: you put the killing thing right between your teeth, but you don't give it the power to do its killing." <br /><br />Augustus, I love you, but you're full of shit right there. Notice how he didn't address Hazel's perfectly valid point that, by buying cigarettes, Augustus is giving money to the people who cause cancer? Because here's the thing: you can say to a cigarette company, "I'm buying your cigarettes as a metaphor, but I won't light them so I'm taking away their power" and they'll stop listening at "I'm buying your cigarettes" because that's all they care about. And it's a shit metaphor in any case: you can walk around a mall with a shotgun and explain to people that because it's unloaded you've taken away its power, but you're still going to get arrested. <br /><br />So that was annoying, as was Augustus's general air of overly-charming pretentious skeeziness in the beginning. But I forgive him for it, because lest we forget, he is seventeen. If his character was twenty-two he'd be the most obnoxious jackass on the planet, but because he's just a kid, I was willing to forgive him. Still hate the cigarette thing, though.<br /><br /></span></div></div></div></section></section><section class="ReviewCard__tags"><ul class="CollapsableList"><a

class="ReviewText"><section class="ReviewText__content"><div class="TruncatedText"><div class="TruncatedText__text TruncatedText__text--5" data-testid="contentContainer"><div><span class="Formatted">It seems silly that I have to say this, but I've seen many a negative review of this book met with backlash from John's nerdfighter fans, so I want to make one thing clear: I like John Green. You'll find plenty who worship him as a god amongst men and many who are highly critical of him, I fall into neither of these categories but I do like him and I enjoy watching his videos. I find him funny and I agree with a lot of what he stands for; I also appreciate the amount of charity work he does and the way he helps the "nerds" feel better about themselves and make it out of high school a little less scarred than they might have been. I like John Green. <br /><br />But I do not particularly like this book. <br /><br />There are plenty of people raving about this book on goodreads, on Kirkus, in various magazines and newspapers... so I realise I am in a tiny minority. I will also admit that I <i>might</i> not have felt the same if I hadn't already subjected myself to numerous "cancer books" but, as it is, I do not feel anything that unique or interesting has been brought to the table here. For the first half (approx), despite my lack of enthusiasm, I expected to give it three stars because I didn't consider it to be a bad book and it was well-written enough; however, as the book wore on, I began to realise that I was growing more and more bored and found myself struggling to read on. This was something I hadn't anticipated. I'd prepared myself for many different possibilities: heartbreak, a changed perspective on life and death, disdain, annoyance... but not bored indifference. Hence the lower rating.<br /><br />One of the first problems I encountered was that the kids were wise beyond their years. And I don't mean intelligent, I mean wise. They came out with things that really only suit people who've been alive a few centuries - like Dumbledore or Gandalf - or at the very least people who are sat comfortably in middle age. I like that Green doesn't patronise his readers by oversimplifying things or dumbing down characters in a condescending effort to appeal to teenagers, but these characters behave in a way that is unnatural to the point where sometimes it is verging on ridiculous. It's not completely unbelievable that some kids exist who are actually like this, but they definitely don't all speak and behave in this way.<br /><br />The characters are all, in one way or another, John Green. They all have his quirkiness, his sense of humour; I was picturing several John Greens sat around having a conversation while I was reading <a href="https://goodreads.com/book/show/11870085.The_Fault_in_Our_Stars" title="The Fault in Our Stars by John Green" rel="noopener">The Fault in Our Stars</a>. In fact, reading this book was a little bit like watching one of Green's vlogs, which might have worked well if JG hadn't dampened the humour with philosophical musings. As it was, I had a book that was trying so very hard to be both funny and sad at the same time and ended up failing to deliver either one as successfully as I would have liked. The dialogue felt false and scripted because of the teens' tendency to showcase their depth and intelligence. Natural conversation between anyone of any age doesn't work like this and I couldn't shake the feeling that there should be a laughter track playing in the background.<br /><br /><a href="https://goodreads.com/book/show/11870085.The_Fault_in_Our_Stars" title="The Fault in Our Stars by John Green" rel="noopener">The Fault in Our Stars</a>, in my opinion, would have been far better if Green had stuck to humour like Andrews did in <a href="https://goodreads.com/book/show/12700353.Me_and_Earl_and_the_Dying_Girl" title="Me and Earl and the Dying Girl by Jesse Andrews" rel="noopener">Me and Earl and the Dying Girl</a>. I believe that the exaggerated characters and their unrealistic conversations would have been fine in a straight-up humour book because that's not supposed to portray something real and deep and moving. But Green loses it by trying to be philosophical and, in the end, I think he has produced a book that is as melodramatic and message-driven as any other on this issue. And his attempt to balance humour and sadness left me somewhat devoid of emotion throughout and provided fewer laughs than I'd hoped.<br /><br />Ultimately, I feel that JG sacrificed humour in order to be deep and philosophical - perhaps this book tried to be too many things, perhaps JG tried to be too clever. But <a href="https://goodreads.com/book/show/12700353.Me_and_Earl_and_the_Dying_Girl" title="Me and Earl and the Dying Girl by Jesse Andrews" rel="noopener">Me and Earl and the Dying Girl</a> was a much better book, in my opinion, because it did the whole serious illness + humour thing but didn't over-complicate things by being philosophical. Like I said near the beginning, perhaps I am just tired of these books and <a href="https://goodreads.com/book/show/11870085.The_Fault_in_Our_Stars" title="The Fault in Our Stars by John Green" rel="noopener">The Fault in Our Stars</a> needs to be appreciated by someone who has not already exhausted themselves on similar efforts. <br /><br /><a href="http://thebookgeek.co.uk" rel="nofollow

must be clear from the beginning. This is perhaps the most personal review I have written. My choice of stars was difficult for this. I am a self confessed John Green fan, I believe he is amongst the best of, not only YA, but fiction writers out there in general. <br />This is a beautifully written book. There is very little to complain about in terms of style, plot, character, etc. However I couldn't, in all good conscience, give this any higher because it sits so badly with me. I have let this novel marinate for a couple of days now before writing this, and I just keep coming back to the same issues. Namely:<br /><br /><b>Was this John Green's story to tell?</b><br /><br />It is the human condition to attempt to find hope in hopeless situations. But let me attempt to explain how watching a 17 year old fade away truly feels. Because when the wit and words are stripped away I am not sure John did that.<br /><br />It is endless. It is an unavoidable and uncontrollable and an all encompassing darkness where no hope or life or explanations exist.<br /><br />There are absolutely no life lessons to be gained from watching a 17 year old cease to exist. There is no comfort. The lessons that some may claim you can achieve through the darkest night of the soul reveal most of humanity for the selfish, narcissistic beings we are.<br /><br />I have come to believe there is a special kind of cruelty behind the perfectly cross stitched 'encouragement'. Those things are for the ones left over trying to make sense of the senseless.<br /><br />Whilst I believe this novel acknowledges that. It tries not to, as the main protagonists claimed theirselves, set the victims of disease up as typical heroic, worldly wise characters, it still reads like a novel attempting to bring equilibrium out of disaster. The victims ultimately still are wise beyond their years. This, it seems, is an assumed side effect of a teenager coming to terms with their mortality. They use metaphors and pretentious poetry and a sharp wit and are wholly unbelievable as real life teenagers. They are constructs of an ideal. They are the literary version of Dawson's Creek, using SAT vocabulary and existential navel gazing, whilst simultaneously slamming the typical genre for using its characters to do the same.<br /><br />Having lived this first hand; once with a brother who ceases to exist at 17 and a second time with a brother who is currently 2 years NEC. I am all too familiar with the need for light hearted humour at what may feel like the most inappropriate of times. But what differs from that and attempting to write a disease ridden novel that attempts to make you laugh, is apparently personal experience. <br /><br />I have the right to sit around a Christmas table laughing somewhat hysterically at nothing. My living brother has the right to crack UNO-ball jokes whenever the opportunity arises. But none of the readers of this novel who have not experienced the kind of loss depicted here have a right to laugh at any of it. You can not claim it as your own unless it is yours, and in my mind that is what humour does. It is not appropriate for me to laugh along with eye jokes and blind jokes, because they are not my jokes. I am merely a voyeur in another persons tragedy, I lay no claim to having the understanding of the experience necessary to allow for laughter.<br /><br />Again, let me make clear. I can not approach this book outside of my personal experience. Of course in reality I do not believe you have to have experienced everything to laugh at a joke. But in terms of purposefully trying to create humour in a novel that is fundamentally tragic, for an audience that is mostly YA, I struggle with. I struggle with it because the empty platitudes that are trying so hard to be subverted in this novel, are still being created. It is still suggesting there can be lightness and humour within the terminally dark - and it is suggesting it to people who have never experienced the terminally dark.<br /><br />This read like a novel where the author has truly witnessed the emptiness of teenage terminal illness, and thankfully appears to have become more considerate and thoughtful for it. As opposed to erring on the side of platitudes.<br />But it still read as a novel attempting to explain where the hope in hopeless situations are.<br /><br />Perhaps because it is too raw a subject for me, or perhaps because the novel really is sentimental and gratuitous (granted in a different way from the norm of this genre) but this is not a book I would recommend.<br />For sufferers, for family members of sufferers, or for well meaning people seeking to understand the hopelessness of some situations. I would recommend it for none.</span></div></div></div></section></section><section class="ReviewCard__tags"><ul class="CollapsableList"><a

What am I supposed to say? How can I do this book justice? Maybe tell you all that it was perfect? The best, most heartbreaking, hilarious book that has touched me like none other? Sure. I mean, it's been said countless times, in countless reviews, and you know what? They are absolutely, a hundred and fifty percent true.</b><br><br>Hazel's days are numbered thanks to her crap lungs. She was able to buy a few years more, thanks to a miracle, but she isn't fooling herself. <i>But when a gorgeous plot twist named Augustus Waters suddenly appears at Cancer Kid Support Group, Hazel's story is about to be completely rewritten. </i><br><img src="https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1380765348ra/3121279.gif" alt="" width="400" class="gr-hostedUserImg" loading="lazy"><br><br>I don't think I've ever cried so much, laughed so much, just over all enjoyed a book as much as I have while reading <i>The Fault in Our Stars.</i> Everything that goes on is serious, heartbreaking and eye opening but John Green does an amazing job at, literally, making you laugh out loud. Even when you're suffering. <br><br>Hazel... what a breathe of fresh air her character was. She was <i>real</i> and I loved her no bullshit attitude. She wasn't fooling herself, and John Green didn't make her out to be ecstatic with the world or her situation. She wasn't bitchy or depressing, but it wasn't like she was perfectly fine to sit idly and watch the time tick by.<br><br><p>Augustus Waters is my dream guy. <strong>Like, for real.</strong> As I wrote on an update: <strong>Screw all the Christian Grey’s and the Gideon Cross’, just give be Augustus Waters.</strong><br></p><blockquote>
  <i>As he read, I fell in love the way you fall asleep: slowly, and then all at once.</i>
</blockquote><br>I fell in love with everything that was… him.<br><p>I was <strong>completely</strong> emotionally invested into the story. It’s not just the main characters that stole my heart, Isaac, the parents, even her damn tank, Phillip, did as well. It was <strong>beautiful</strong>, it was <strong>hilarious</strong>, and it was <strong>perfect.</strong><br></p><blockquote>
  <em>"Maybe <strong>okay</strong> will be our <strong>always.</strong>"</em>
</blockquote><br>Everybody tells you to have your tissues fully loaded because you’re going to need them, and of course my first thought is <em>suuuureee</em>. Don’t get me wrong, I’ve teared up in plenty of books, but actually <strong>cried</strong>? Nah. Well, I step down and admit defeat. I freakin’ sobbed my heart out. John Green, you’ve done what only few have been able to do... make me cry.<br><br><br><strong>*A thanks to all the ladies that BR this with me (and the ones who crashed it) I wouldn’t have gone near

class="Formatted">As seen on <a href="http://www.thereadventurer.com/2/post/2012/02/the-fault-in-our-stars-by-john-green.html" rel="nofollow noopener">The Readventurer</a><br /><br /><br /><a href="https://goodreads.com/book/show/11870085.The_Fault_in_Our_Stars" title="The Fault in Our Stars by John Green" rel="noopener">The Fault in Our Stars</a> currently has a rating of 4.74 on Goodreads, almost everyone I know has given it 5 stars, therefore I'm certain no one would want to read my sour musings, except me and maybe a couple of other like-minded and unimpressed.<br /><br />What I'd love to know is this - what makes a writer undertake the topic of cancer? So much has already been written about it, so many <i>Lifetime</i> movies filmed, so many tears shed. It literally has been done to death. What new did <a href="https://goodreads.com/author/show/1406384.John_Green" title="John Green" rel="noopener">John Green</a> have to bring to the cancer table?<br /><br />The way I see it, nothing. Having your terminally sick characters be ironic about their illnesses and swap cancer jokes isn't groundbreaking.<br /><br /><a href="https://goodreads.com/book/show/11870085.The_Fault_in_Our_Stars" title="The Fault in Our Stars by John Green" rel="noopener">The Fault in Our Stars</a> isn't a bad book, but it's a standard cancer book, and, sadly, a standard <a href="https://goodreads.com/author/show/1406384.John_Green" title="John Green" rel="noopener">John Green</a> book, with standard <a href="https://goodreads.com/author/show/1406384.John_Green" title="John Green" rel="noopener">John Green</a> humor and standard <a href="https://goodreads.com/author/show/1406384.John_Green" title="John Green" rel="noopener">John Green</a> characters speaking in the very same <a href="https://goodreads.com/author/show/1406384.John_Green" title="John Green" rel="noopener">John Green</a> voice. <br /><br />You have a witty and intelligent protagonist (this time 2, Hazel and Augustus - a female and male versions of Miles/Quentin/Colin), a funny, slightly pathetic sidekick (Isaac - another version of Hassan/Chip/Marcus), a mysterious, unhinged girl, Gus's dead ex (Alaska/Margo clone), and, of course, the signature ROAD TRIP. I can't help but recognize these people and this plot, I've read all of Green's novels.<br /><br />I understand why so many readers would have such an emotional response to the book. Nothing will get the ladies crying quicker than a kid dying of cancer. Add in some long farewells, painkillers, eulogies and funerals - you can collect buckets of tears. But, IMO, here Green aims for the most obvious, the most easily accessible emotions, for the most typical "life lessons." And for all Green's attempts to be subversive and to make fun of "cancer cliches" - inspirational quotes, heroic cancer survivors, etc. he ended up writing about exactly the same things. <br /><br />Frankly, I think <a href="https://goodreads.com/book/show/11870085.The_Fault_in_Our_Stars" title="The Fault in Our Stars by John Green" rel="noopener">The Fault in Our Stars</a> is Green's weakest work to date, weaker even than half-baked <a href="https://goodreads.com/book/show/10268370.Zombicorns" title="Zombicorns by John Green" rel="noopener">Zombicorns</a>. Because this, unlike his earlier works, feels commercial and intentionally tearjerky and insincere. It will probably sell the most copies. </span></div></div></div></section></section><section class="ReviewCard__tags"><ul class="CollapsableList"><a

loading="lazy"><br><br>*pointless EDIT* Woooah! 1000+ likes!? I'm surprised how many people are willing to read my little blurb of nothingness! <br><br>*EDIT* In a lot of peoples reviews I keep seeing "they don't talk their age!" or "They make these beautiful long speeches which is something that normal teenagers don't do" and I have to point out that Augustus and Hazel AREN'T normal teenagers. They've had to go through so much more in their lifetime than a lot of teenagers will ever have to, and its aged them. And quite honestly, this book wouldn't be as good if they were "normal" (whatever that means) <br>*sighs* okay I'm done, proceed with reading. If you want to, I'm just tiny words on a screen. Do whatever you want.<br><br><br>As much of an amazing writer as I want to be.... I'm really not. So I'll just point out the things that made this book amazing. ;)<br>I knew that I would cry so I really didn't bother swearing not to cry. What I didn't expect is bawling my eyes out. I really didn't. John Green has done an amazing job of making these characters feel so real to me. When they cried, I cried (bawled). When they laughed, I laughed. When they melted, I melted. Their romance was so epic and I know, I KNOW, that this is a book I will read over and over again and cry every single time.<br><br> The characters were perfection! Especially Augustus Waters. Not only is his name Augustus (which is epic in itself) He had the guts to go up to Hazel and just straight up ask her to come hang out with him. Nice guys finish last? I think not.<br><br> You know this book was so awesmazing that I gave it its own tag. Just look up there and you'll see a little tag that says "the-fault-in-our-stars". It was THAT amazing. Seriously. So amazing that I'm pretty sure it was my first heartbreak... from a book. I really haven't felt that much from a book, much less a person, in a very long time. (I'm kind of a loner and a commitment phob... not a good mix) But my heart didn't just do this 3, it did this » *BOOM!* (didn't have a sign for that)<br><br>I wish I could write more about this book, but I just can't explain the amazingness of it with my simple, unworthy words, so I am going to tell you what you NEED to do....<br><b> READ IT </b></span></div></div></div></section></section><section class="ReviewCard__tags"><ul class="CollapsableList"><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/3073744?shelf=best-characters"

Well, you realize that it just, you know, sucks. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eVH: *mumbles* How 'bout: you suck?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMe: What was that? Actually, forget it, I don't give a shit. Listen to this! \u003cblockquote\u003e“My thoughts are stars I cannot fathom into constellations.”\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eVH: So? It's beautiful.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMe: Well...*tries really hard to refrain from laughing* I mean... Seriously? Like... *fails miserably* HAHAHAHA how more pretentious can you get? Comparing your \u003ci\u003ethoughts\u003c/i\u003e to stars? REALLY?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eVH: You're so shallow. Some of us have deep thoughts, you know. Like, thoughts so deep they actually deserve to be compared to the firmament. I don't even want to explain to you how poetic this is, because I'd waste my time. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMe: Save yourself the effort, I don't mind. And I've got another example.

Or that's the thing about food. It demands to be eaten. Or that's the thing about...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eVH: SHUT UP, I get it! There's no discussion with you. How am I supposed to discuss with someone who's got the intellectual depth of an empty oyster?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMe: But come on, I'm not finished yet. What about Augustus and his unlit cigarette?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e“They don’t kill you unless you light them,” he said. “And I’ve never lit one.

Say metaphor one more time! Go ahead, say it, I think John Green hasn't totally forced it down my throat yet! *hysterical yelling* LET'S SAY IT AGAIN! Metaphor!

It made my eyes burn. It's pretentious and unbelievable, AND besides, you can totally see that John Green loves the characters.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eVH: What author doesn't like the characters of their own book?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMe: It's not the same! With John Green... It's like he adores himself. I bet you anything he re-reads his own books. Just to see exactly how \u003ci\u003eawesome\u003c/i\u003e they are. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eVH: What? You don't know that. You cannot possibly say that. How dare you talk about him like you know him.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMe: You know, in the audio version of The Fault in Our Stars, at the end, there's an interview with him. And he explicitly says that he just LOVES listening to the audio versions of his books. So there.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eVH: What? No. You're wrong. He doesn't mean, like, he loves it when someone reads him his own books. That's not what he meant AT ALL. It's a misunderstanding. What he meant was, he loves listening to the.. the.. \u003ci\u003ereading lady\u003c/i\u003e. Because she has \u003ci\u003esuch\u003c/i\u003e a sweet voice and everything. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMe: Are you kidding me? He's in love with himself! Augustus is just an hologram. An empty shell. Seriously, his monologues are laughable. I couldn't even focus. I kept thinking of John Green while reading. Because Augustus is just SO witty, so smart, so perfect. *cough cough* \u003cs\u003ewish fulfillment hello\u003c/s\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eVH: I am so not convinced.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMe: There's this whole repetition thing, too. I cannot believe how all the characters of his books look alike. How come it works every SINGLE time? How many books are out there, now? 4? 5? More, surely. It's always the SAME THING. Geeky and nerdy narrator, geekier and nerdier sidekick, mysterious but unbelievable girl, random plot that doesn't even make sense, road trip. Come the fuck on. You know what? The fact that people aren't getting tired of him and his stupid same characters is the real question.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eVH: But this book is unique. The way it deals with cancer and death... It's so beautiful. You cannot possibly say it isn't.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMe: That's what disturbed me the most. Look. What I want to say is, not every death is glorious. Not every death is epic and not every death will glow like a star in the eternal twilight sky. Most of the time, deaths are random, plain, and the world is cold and uncaring, and that's how it is. And that's what's terrible. You don't need to be a hero, you don't need to defy death the way Augustus pretends to, you don't need to lose yourself in unbelievable speeches to have people cry over your death. The book is just TOO much. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eVH: You know, about them being unbelievable when they talk? You seem to forget something. Augustus and Hazel ARE different. They're unique, so they talk different. That's what it's all about.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMe: They're not different, they don't exist. They \u003ci\u003ecan't\u003c/i\u003e exist. Honestly? I don't think this was a good tribute to the kids who are really sick. Because no one talks like that, NO ONE, and I feel like now there's this messed-up hierarchy between the sick kids who are sort of smart ass and those who aren't. And I refuse that. I can't accept that. \u003cb\u003eBeing ironic, jaded, detached and all metaphorical over the disease is a luxury that genuinely sick teenagers cannot afford.\u003c/b\u003e So fuck this. And I'd rather kneel before a kid who has cancer and who doesn't know what a metaphor is than shed a tear over one of Augustus's stupid monologues.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eVH: You liar, I know you cried while you read the book. You were a sobbing mess.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMe: I wasn't. I was a sobbing mess at the end of \u003ca href=\"https://goodreads.com/book/show/1314332.Before_I_Die\" title=\"Before I Die by Jenny Downham\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003eBefore I Die\u003c/a\u003e.

These are all gorgeous books that deal with cancer. And I cried \u003cs\u003elike a bitch\u003c/s\u003e every single time, and they broke my heart. But this? I didn't cry.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eVH: You did, and you know it. Especially at THIS special moment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMe: *looks away* I don't know what you're talking about.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eVH : You cried when Hazel asked her mom if she would still be a mom after her death.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMe: Fine, okay. I cried. I know. Okay? I know. But look. That's precisely the point. That's what I call emotional blackmail. Because I DARE YOU not to cry over that discussion. Because it's a universal fear! Whether you're a mom, or a daughter, or both, if you have a sister even, you must have thought about that already and told yourself : Okay, if I die, or if she dies. Who will I be? If my sister dies and I'm asked whether I have a sibling, what should I say? Am I still a sister because she existed, once? Or if you have a child, and then one day your baby dies. What happens then? Are you still a parent? Are you still a parent because once, you \u003ci\u003eused to\u003c/i\u003e be a parent, and because there's a room upstairs that \u003ci\u003eused\u003c/i\u003e to be your child's? I dare you to think about it and not end up crying. I took it as a betrayal from John Green because I feel like he didn't play fair. OF COURSE talking about a child's death in this peculiar way will make the reader cry! But it's so easy. It doesn't require any talent. Just ask anyone to talk about that and they'll be tearing up in 5 seconds! Do you understand what I'm trying to say? I feel like he was like, \"I'm gonna make them cry.\" and all the while I was reading I swear I could hear him: \"ARE YOU SAD YET? ARE YOU HEARTBROKEN YET? DO YOU SEE HOW INCREDIBLY UPSETTING MY STORY IS? I KNOW, RIGHT. I AMAZE MYSELF SOMETIMES.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eVH: But--\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMe: No, look. Writing like that, it's not incredible, it's not magical and it's not valuable. It's playing with people's weaknesses. It's manipulating people into crying. And I can't respect him with that the way I respect people who manage to make me cry without using such poor plot devices. Like in, \u003ca href=\"https://goodreads.com/book/show/12700353.Me_and_Earl_and_the_Dying_Girl\" title=\"Me and Earl and the Dying Girl by Jesse Andrews\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003eMe and Earl and The Dying Girl\u003c/a\u003e. There's a cancer book that really took me by surprise. Because, Rachel, the sick girl, is everything but admirable. She's young, a bit shallow, nice, shy, plain, normal, really. And her neighbor who befriends her, he doesn't fall in love with her. And her death won't be remembered like something that scarred humanity, because it didn't. Ultimately, it didn't even matter at all. And I could relate more easily to that, to the meaningless dimension of her death, to the emptiness of it all, more than I could ever relate to the ridiculous speeches of Augustus (and Hazel's too, for that matter). Because you know what bothered me, too? They're indistinct. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eVH: That's because they're soul mates. That's the whole point of the book. They found themselves in each other.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMe: It doesn't work to say they're soul mates. Look, I read the book almost a year ago, I think. And this:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e“I’m in love with you, and I’m not in the business of denying myself the simple pleasure of saying true things.

It's also unrealistic that a teenager would ever say that, let alone improvize it, but whatever, it's pretty. But the thing is, I am completely unable to say whether it's Augustus or Hazel who says that. I don't know. I have no idea.

I didn't love the book, and I am not in the business of denying myself the simple pleasure of saying true things; I didn't love the book, and I know this review might be just a shout into the void, and that oblivion is inevitable, and that we're all doomed to another John Green book about an unbelievable loser \u003cs\u003eand his even more loser sidekick\u003c/s\u003e loving an unbelievable teenage girl, and that there will come a day when maybe he will change his writing formula, and maybe that'll come when the sun will swallow the only earth we'll ever have, but then it'll be too late, so who cares?

(25/06/2014)-\u003c/b\u003e\n\u003c/u\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince I've been receiving a lot of cyber bullies and hate messages, I’m going to clarify few things.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Firstly, this is a negative review of the book and it has got a lot of potential to infuriate the fans. If you think that your opinion is the only opinion that exists on earth and that no one should dislike your favourite book, then I would suggest you to avoid this review.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-\u003cb\u003eStop harassing me\u003c/b\u003e. Why can't you get it through your thick skulls that everyone has different opinions, they’re going to interpret books differently from you and stop being selfish to think that just because you loved a book that means the whole world should love it. This world is full of people with differing opinions, differing thoughts and differing likes and differing dislikes, learn to respect them even if you don’t agree with what they have to say about your favourite books. Just because you love a particular book that I hate doesn't make you a good person and me a bad person, It simply shows that people like different things. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery reader has the freedom to dissect and critically analyse any book and write their thoughts on it in their own review space without the fear of anyone (or fans bossing them into writing what the fandom wants). Critically analysing books and criticising problematic aspects of any reading material prevents people from being passive readers.\u003cb\u003eShakespeare and J.K Rowling too have their own share of critics then what makes Green’s book flawless that it’s not allowed to be criticised?\u003c/b\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-\u003cb\u003eStop cyber bullying and trolling me.\u003c/b\u003e Your hate messages and death threats will show much more of your personality than your love for this book. Remember, every time you comment any bullshit here, you’re giving your own fandom a bad name and my review more popularity. Also, your hate messages aren't going to put me down. I’m a strong girl and I’m always going to stand up for what I believe in come hell or high water. I don't fear anyone and no one can ever force me to follow their orders like a puppet especially not a fandom where \u003cb\u003emost\u003c/b\u003e of the fans are immature cyber bullies who can’t respect other’s opinions. Also, I've caught fans making fake accounts to troll my review, this shows me that they are big cowards who hide their faces and send me spiteful comments.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Lastly, I’m NOT shaming anyone for loving this book. You can love whatever you want to and believe in whomever you want to. I have no problem with people who genuinely love this book;\u003cb\u003e I have problems with those who think readers should not have the rights to express their dislike for any book, I have problems with those who approve of and participate in cyber bullying reviewers who write negative reviews on their favourite books, I have problems with those who refuse to acknowledge the fact that their favourite books can have flaws and not everyone’s going to love them, I have problems with those who come here to shove their opinions down my throat. Do you find anyone who hated this book shoving their opinions in comments of positive reviews? Then what makes you think that you have the rights to troll negative reviews?\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlright, now let's begin with the review.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003e\n  \u003cu\u003e**WARNING- MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD**\u003c/u\u003e\n\u003c/b\u003e\t\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eEXPECTATION-\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1380222758ra/627831.gif\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1380387347ra/747345.gif\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1380387347ra/747346.gif\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eREALITY-\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1380387347ra/747347.gif\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1380222758ra/625186.gif\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1382292005ra/5792188.gif\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I happily bought the hardcover of The Fault in our stars back in December 2012 after seeing the high average GR ratings and raving reviews saying how beautiful, life-changing, thought-provoking and blah blah it is. Surprisingly, this book was so \u003ci\u003especial\u003c/i\u003e that it became the first book that I slammed on the wall twice after reading it. It didn’t only disappoint me but also angered me. I'm surprised to find that harsh critics are swallowing up this trash and calling it a masterpiece. Ugh! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI’m going to make a list of everything I hate about this book that earned it the topmost place on my list of \u003cb\u003eWorst books ever.\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cu\u003e\n  \u003cb\u003eThe characters-\u003c/b\u003e\n\u003c/u\u003e Hazel and Augustus are the flattest cardboard cut-outs I have ever seen in any book. Both of them were like 60-years-old stuck in some teenager's bodies making them very boring and unlikable. Hazel was such an annoying, stupid and pretentious Mary Sue that I wanted to punch her right in the face. One great example of her stupidity-\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci\u003e”Why are breakfast foods breakfast foods...Like, why don’t we have curry for breakfast?”\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"A nonhot boy stares at you relentlessly and it is, at best, awkward and, at worst, a form of assault.\u003cbr\u003eBut a hot boy . . . well.\"\u003c/i\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAugustus and Hazel have the same boring, pretentious, know-it-all and indistinguishable personality. Hazel is the female version of Augustus (no, I’m not going to call him affectionately with Gus) and he is the male version of Hazel. These two characters meld together and have no depth at all. I couldn’t connect with them, I felt no pain and sympathy for them and they annoyed me so much that I wanted to stab them.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cu\u003e\n  \u003cb\u003eRomance-\u003c/b\u003e\n\u003c/u\u003e It fell from the sky.

They both fall in love within seconds just after laying eyes on each other \u003cb\u003e\n  \u003ci\u003e~love at first sight~\u003c/i\u003e\n\u003c/b\u003e. The romance is undeveloped and it comes from nowhere. I was baffled when Hazel accepted to go to Augustus's house just minutes after meeting him. WHAT THE HELL? How stupid can you be? You fall for a guy's words whom you met just few minutes ago and agree to go to his house! \u003cb\u003eWhat if he were a murderer or rapist?\u003c/b\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNot to mention that the kissing scene in Anne Frank's house was so effing disgusting. Anne Frank's house is considered to be a place of remembrance, a place where 2 families hid during the dark days of Holocaust. If anyone makes out at such a revered site, they would be kicked out regardless of who or what they are. People present around will be disgusted, they won't stand and watch much less clap for the \"lovely\" couple.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cu\u003e\n  \u003cb\u003eWriting-\u003c/b\u003e\n\u003c/u\u003e Cheesy.

No teen can spontaneously come up with long monologues within seconds. Also, genuinely sick teenagers don’t have the luxury to be so witty and clever every single time. One thing I don't buy is that teens with cancer suddenly become magically wise. They become terrified, confused, depressed and angry. They DON’T magically gain great insight in life and go around puking long monologues about the meaning of life.\u003c/b\u003e This book made me roll my eyes in disgust. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003e\n  \u003ci\u003e(UPDATE- In response to gazillion questions and arguments I've been getting on the paragraphs above, I have written a detailed explanation below)***\u003c/i\u003e\n\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003e\n  \u003cu\u003ePlot-\u003c/u\u003e\n\u003c/b\u003e Predictable.

Green tried to make his death sound LIKE HE WENT TO A PARTY LAST WEEK!!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOk, so this book made you cry, right? If a book makes you cry it doesn’t mean that it’s a masterpiece. I can understand that you must’ve felt sad and sympathetic for the characters and must’ve cried but considering that this novel is sad and it made you cry doesn’t make it an awesome, life-changing and beautiful story. I cried after reading Allegiant for days but I hated that book with burning passion, it was one of the worst books I ever read. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBefore you start calling me a cold-hearted bitch for hating and criticising this book, let me tell you that if you think you have every right to go around fangirling how wonderful this book was then I believe that I have every right to express my hatred for it whether you like it or not.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003e***\u003c/b\u003e I never mentioned or implied that teenagers are illiterate or can't have a large vocabulary, don't accuse me of something I haven't said. I just find it hard to believe that any teen can come up with nonsensical monologues like the ones below or think it's appropriate to use them in their conversations-\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci\u003e\"I’m awash in the metaphorical resonance of the empty playground in the hospital courtyard” \u003cbr\u003e“That kid never took a piss without pondering the abundant metaphysical resonances of human waste production”.\u003c/i\u003e (wtf?!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt's hard to believe that anyone would talk like that in a normal conversation every single time.\u003cbr\u003eI am a teen and I go to high school, I know many other teens of my age who have developed a large vocabulary and have brilliant writing skills. That is simply because they love reading and have developed the habit of learning new words from the dictionary from a very young age. They write amazing poems and honestly, it takes them a lot of time to ponder over and make their metaphors or poems perfect. They obviously cannot open their mouth and spontaneously say\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci\u003e\"My thoughts are stars I cannot fathom into constellations\".\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBtw, none of the teenage characters from this book show any interest in reading high literature and poetry (the only book Hazel claims to read is \u003ci\u003eAn Imperial Affliction\u003c/i\u003e) then what's the reason behind their ability to spew pretentious monologues? \u003cb\u003eThey aren't geniuses, they aren't teens who read avidly or analyse high literature and show interest in oratory, existentialist philosophy and poetry. Therefore, it's not plausible for them to speak with profound words.\u003c/b\u003e I would believe their monologues had they shown interest in Kant, Sartre, Nietzsche and Heidegger.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow going over the cigarette metaphor, Augustus buys a pack of cigarettes regularly just so he could put one in his mouth and not light it thus, giving us another stupid dialogue \"It's a metaphor. You keep the killing thing between your teeth but don't give it the power to kill you\". Funny that he won't kill himself by lighting up the cigarette but will regularly give money to an industry that is the largest cause of cancer thus, promoting the cigarette industry and indirectly killing others. (What a genius!) Not to mention that he mocks Hazel's cancer right on her face and guess her reaction? She's impressed and readily approves of and participants in his metaphor.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere's a lot of difference between being wise and being pretentious and Hazel and Augustus are the latter. I don't buy their dialogues because they are extremely ridiculous and cheesy and no argument by fans and authors can change my opinion because Green makes no effort in making the dialogues IN THE BOOK seem plausible. There's no reason for their large vocabulary and ability to spew long monologues IN THE BOOK. I've read Green's post on Augustus' character being pretentious and imo, he misses the point that his characters are not only pretentious; they are extremely unrealistic as well. Augustus' pretension is not \"an intentional flaw\", it's simply poor characterisation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI'm not saying that kids with cancer cannot be intelligent. A lot of fans say that the characters in the book are special and wise because they have cancer and this book tries hard to show that too. I merely said that having cancer does not mean that you can automatically become wise and gain a lot of knowledge. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI couldn't sympathise with the characters and feel their pain. That doesn't mean that I'm cold hearted. \u003cb\u003eIt's not my fault that I couldn't get emotionally connected to the characters, it's the authors fault for not writing characters I could sympathise with. It's the author's fault for making shallow, judgemental and annoying characters. It's the his fault for making characters with personality that mocks cancer patients and who show disrespect to millions of people who died in the Holocaust. It's the author's fault for romanticising cancer and using it as a ploy to sell his book.\u003c/b\u003e I'm NOT hating people who have cancer, I'm NOT hating the characters because they have cancer. I'm hating them for who they are. I'm hating the book because it's poorly written. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don't need to have cancer to analyse this book.

Larger than Hazel saying, “I wanna tap that” about Augustus on page 8. This prose was not the voice of a real teenager. It tried, but this did not sound like a teenager suffering from cancer.

age twenty-two, John Green worked as a student chaplain in a children's hospital. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eLet's take a moment and consider all the implications of that, and why he is making a colossal understatement when he described the experience as \"devastating.\" That was about twelve years ago, and Green has said in interviews that because of this experience, he's spent twelve years trying to write a book about kids with cancer - not poster children of strength and courage and illness-granted wisdom, but real kids and their families and friends who have to cope with the fact that they will die young. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAll novels are personal, but Green's novels seem, to me, to be especially so. But this one is personal in a different way. With this novel, Green isn't trying to exorcize the memory of \u003ca href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/107137255\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003ethe girl\u003c/a\u003e who \u003ca href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/95559975\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003estomped on his heart\u003c/a\u003e in \u003ca href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/93836698\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003ehigh school\u003c/a\u003e. This goes deeper than high school romance and Manic Pixie Dream Girl angst. This is about life, death, illness, love, heroism, and how a sixteen-year-old is supposed to deal with the fact that she will die and leave everyone she loves behind. Maybe it's just because I've been watching vlogbrothers videos for four years and feel like I'm actually acquainted with John Green, but this is the most deeply personal novel I've ever read. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThis is not, as Hazel Lancaster might say, a Cancer Book. None of the cancer patients in this story have a wisdom beyond their years, and they do not stoically accept the fact that they will die or fight heroically. Hazel Lancaster, a terminal sixteen-year-old who has to carry an oxygen tank everywhere because \"my lungs suck at being lungs\" is refreshingly real - not manic, not a pixie, not a dream girl. She reads Great Books and watches \u003ci\u003eAmerica's Next Top Model\u003c/i\u003e marathons. Augustus Waters, her amputee friend, wants desperately to leave a lasting impression on the world and philosophizes about heroism, and his favorite book is a novelization of a video game. (can I say how much I love that an author can establish a character's intelligence without telling us that they love reading Austen \u003ci\u003eyes Stephenie Meyer I'm looking at you\u003c/i\u003e) Everything here is real, especially the diseases. There isn't any bullshit about dying gracefully here, because cancer is \u003ci\u003eugly\u003c/i\u003e and unpleasant, and Green makes you feel Hazel's lungs struggling to breathe and the pain, and see the vomit and urine. (Remember how in \u003ci\u003eA Walk to Remember\u003c/i\u003e, Mandy Moore has been secretly dying of leukemia the whole time but looks great even on her deathbed? Nicholas Sparks can fuck right off for that insult to real cancer patients) Most importantly, Hazel and Augustus are not defined by their cancer. It consumes their lives, but it doesn't define them. On every page, it's clear: this is a story told by someone who hasn't known just one person with cancer, but has seen a multitude of children with terminal diseases, and has tried to find some way to comfort them and their families. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eIt's for that reason that I don't feel like I can review this like a normal book. John Green didn't write this story for me, and so I don't feel like I have any place saying that it's amazing and beautiful and heartbreaking. And I certainly can't criticize any of its minor faults. All I can say, really, is that you have to read this for yourself, and go from there. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e...\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eOkay, you guys know me better than that. I have one big complaint, which I will describe here, and all I ask is that you remember that I still gave this five stars. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAugustus Waters, in the first few chapters, comes off as a pretentious douche. When Hazel first meets him at a cancer support group, they're talking afterwards and Augustus takes out a cigarette and puts it in his mouth. Hazel, who you'll recall is dying because her lungs cannot function, freaks out: \"...even though you HAD FREAKING CANCER you give money to a company in exchange for the chance to acquire YET MORE CANCER.\" Augustus explains that he doesn't smoke the cigarettes, he just puts them in his mouth (no, really) because \"They don't kill you unless you light them...And I've never lit one. It's a metaphor, see: you put the killing thing right between your teeth, but you don't give it the power to do its killing.\" \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAugustus, I love you, but you're full of shit right there. Notice how he didn't address Hazel's perfectly valid point that, by buying cigarettes, Augustus is giving money to the people who cause cancer? Because here's the thing: you can say to a cigarette company, \"I'm buying your cigarettes as a metaphor, but I won't light them so I'm taking away their power\" and they'll stop listening at \"I'm buying your cigarettes\" because that's all they care about. And it's a shit metaphor in any case: you can walk around a mall with a shotgun and explain to people that because it's unloaded you've taken away its power, but you're still going to get arrested. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eSo that was annoying, as was Augustus's general air of overly-charming pretentious skeeziness in the beginning. But I forgive him for it, because lest we forget, he is seventeen. If his character was twenty-two he'd be the most obnoxious jackass on the planet, but because he's just a kid, I was willing to forgive him. Still hate the cigarette thing, though.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e","rating":5,"shelving":{"__typename":"Shelving","shelf":{"__typename":"Shelf","name":"read","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/111921?shelf=read"},"taggings":[{"__typename":"Tagging","tag":{"__typename":"Tag","name":"kids-and-young-adult","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/111921?shelf=kids-and-young-adult"}}],"webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/263940570"},"likeCount":752,"viewerHasLiked":null,"commentCount":87,"viewerCanComment({\"resourceType\":\"review\"})":null},"User:4622890":{"id":4622890,"__typename":"User","legacyId":4622890,"imageUrlSquare":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/users/1528390751i/4622890._UY200_CR2,0,200,200_.jpg","isAuthor":false,"textReviewsCount":1848,"viewableName":"Emily May","isBlockedByViewer":false,"webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4622890-emily-may","contributor":null,"isFollowing":false,"isFriend":false,"followersCount":275656},"Review:kca://review:goodreads/amzn1.gr.review:goodreads.v1.St331eam7dOMlQTAX1zaiw":{"id":"kca://review:goodreads/amzn1.gr.review:goodreads.v1.St331eam7dOMlQTAX1zaiw","__typename":"Review","book":{"__ref":"Book:kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.6rIwidkUTORGkQo3jY4dcg"},"creator":{"__ref":"User:4622890"},"recommendFor":null,"updatedAt":1491984820243,"createdAt":1359975185000,"spoilerStatus":false,"lastRevisionAt":1416668001000,"text":"It seems silly that I have to say this, but I've seen many a negative review of this book met with backlash from John's nerdfighter fans, so I want to make one thing clear: I like John Green. You'll find plenty who worship him as a god amongst men and many who are highly critical of him, I fall into neither of these categories but I do like him and I enjoy watching his videos. I find him funny and I agree with a lot of what he stands for; I also appreciate the amount of charity work he does and the way he helps the \"nerds\" feel better about themselves and make it out of high school a little less scarred than they might have been. I like John Green. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eBut I do not particularly like this book. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThere are plenty of people raving about this book on goodreads, on Kirkus, in various magazines and newspapers... so I realise I am in a tiny minority. I will also admit that I \u003ci\u003emight\u003c/i\u003e not have felt the same if I hadn't already subjected myself to numerous \"cancer books\" but, as it is, I do not feel anything that unique or interesting has been brought to the table here. For the first half (approx), despite my lack of enthusiasm, I expected to give it three stars because I didn't consider it to be a bad book and it was well-written enough; however, as the book wore on, I began to realise that I was growing more and more bored and found myself struggling to read on. This was something I hadn't anticipated. I'd prepared myself for many different possibilities: heartbreak, a changed perspective on life and death, disdain, annoyance... but not bored indifference. Hence the lower rating.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eOne of the first problems I encountered was that the kids were wise beyond their years. And I don't mean intelligent, I mean wise. They came out with things that really only suit people who've been alive a few centuries - like Dumbledore or Gandalf - or at the very least people who are sat comfortably in middle age. I like that Green doesn't patronise his readers by oversimplifying things or dumbing down characters in a condescending effort to appeal to teenagers, but these characters behave in a way that is unnatural to the point where sometimes it is verging on ridiculous. It's not completely unbelievable that some kids exist who are actually like this, but they definitely don't all speak and behave in this way.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe characters are all, in one way or another, John Green. They all have his quirkiness, his sense of humour; I was picturing several John Greens sat around having a conversation while I was reading \u003ca href=\"https://goodreads.com/book/show/11870085.The_Fault_in_Our_Stars\" title=\"The Fault in Our Stars by John Green\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003eThe Fault in Our Stars\u003c/a\u003e. In fact, reading this book was a little bit like watching one of Green's vlogs, which might have worked well if JG hadn't dampened the humour with philosophical musings. As it was, I had a book that was trying so very hard to be both funny and sad at the same time and ended up failing to deliver either one as successfully as I would have liked. The dialogue felt false and scripted because of the teens' tendency to showcase their depth and intelligence. Natural conversation between anyone of any age doesn't work like this and I couldn't shake the feeling that there should be a laughter track playing in the background.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://goodreads.com/book/show/11870085.The_Fault_in_Our_Stars\" title=\"The Fault in Our Stars by John Green\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003eThe Fault in Our Stars\u003c/a\u003e, in my opinion, would have been far better if Green had stuck to humour like Andrews did in \u003ca href=\"https://goodreads.com/book/show/12700353.Me_and_Earl_and_the_Dying_Girl\" title=\"Me and Earl and the Dying Girl by Jesse Andrews\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003eMe and Earl and the Dying Girl\u003c/a\u003e. I believe that the exaggerated characters and their unrealistic conversations would have been fine in a straight-up humour book because that's not supposed to portray something real and deep and moving. But Green loses it by trying to be philosophical and, in the end, I think he has produced a book that is as melodramatic and message-driven as any other on this issue. And his attempt to balance humour and sadness left me somewhat devoid of emotion throughout and provided fewer laughs than I'd hoped.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eUltimately, I feel that JG sacrificed humour in order to be deep and philosophical - perhaps this book tried to be too many things, perhaps JG tried to be too clever. But \u003ca href=\"https://goodreads.com/book/show/12700353.Me_and_Earl_and_the_Dying_Girl\" title=\"Me and Earl and the Dying Girl by Jesse Andrews\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003eMe and Earl and the Dying Girl\u003c/a\u003e was a much better book, in my opinion, because it did the whole serious illness + humour thing but didn't over-complicate things by being philosophical.

This is perhaps the most personal review I have written. My choice of stars was difficult for this. I am a self confessed John Green fan, I believe he is amongst the best of, not only YA, but fiction writers out there in general. \u003cbr /\u003eThis is a beautifully written book. There is very little to complain about in terms of style, plot, character, etc. However I couldn't, in all good conscience, give this any higher because it sits so badly with me. I have let this novel marinate for a couple of days now before writing this, and I just keep coming back to the same issues. Namely:\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003eWas this John Green's story to tell?\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eIt is the human condition to attempt to find hope in hopeless situations. But let me attempt to explain how watching a 17 year old fade away truly feels. Because when the wit and words are stripped away I am not sure John did that.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eIt is endless. It is an unavoidable and uncontrollable and an all encompassing darkness where no hope or life or explanations exist.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThere are absolutely no life lessons to be gained from watching a 17 year old cease to exist. There is no comfort. The lessons that some may claim you can achieve through the darkest night of the soul reveal most of humanity for the selfish, narcissistic beings we are.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eI have come to believe there is a special kind of cruelty behind the perfectly cross stitched 'encouragement'. Those things are for the ones left over trying to make sense of the senseless.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eWhilst I believe this novel acknowledges that. It tries not to, as the main protagonists claimed theirselves, set the victims of disease up as typical heroic, worldly wise characters, it still reads like a novel attempting to bring equilibrium out of disaster. The victims ultimately still are wise beyond their years. This, it seems, is an assumed side effect of a teenager coming to terms with their mortality. They use metaphors and pretentious poetry and a sharp wit and are wholly unbelievable as real life teenagers. They are constructs of an ideal. They are the literary version of Dawson's Creek, using SAT vocabulary and existential navel gazing, whilst simultaneously slamming the typical genre for using its characters to do the same.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eHaving lived this first hand; once with a brother who ceases to exist at 17 and a second time with a brother who is currently 2 years NEC. I am all too familiar with the need for light hearted humour at what may feel like the most inappropriate of times. But what differs from that and attempting to write a disease ridden novel that attempts to make you laugh, is apparently personal experience. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eI have the right to sit around a Christmas table laughing somewhat hysterically at nothing. My living brother has the right to crack UNO-ball jokes whenever the opportunity arises. But none of the readers of this novel who have not experienced the kind of loss depicted here have a right to laugh at any of it. You can not claim it as your own unless it is yours, and in my mind that is what humour does. It is not appropriate for me to laugh along with eye jokes and blind jokes, because they are not my jokes. I am merely a voyeur in another persons tragedy, I lay no claim to having the understanding of the experience necessary to allow for laughter.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAgain, let me make clear. I can not approach this book outside of my personal experience. Of course in reality I do not believe you have to have experienced everything to laugh at a joke. But in terms of purposefully trying to create humour in a novel that is fundamentally tragic, for an audience that is mostly YA, I struggle with. I struggle with it because the empty platitudes that are trying so hard to be subverted in this novel, are still being created. It is still suggesting there can be lightness and humour within the terminally dark - and it is suggesting it to people who have never experienced the terminally dark.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThis read like a novel where the author has truly witnessed the emptiness of teenage terminal illness, and thankfully appears to have become more considerate and thoughtful for it. As opposed to erring on the side of platitudes.\u003cbr /\u003eBut it still read as a novel attempting to explain where the hope in hopeless situations are.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003ePerhaps because it is too raw a subject for me, or perhaps because the novel really is sentimental and gratuitous (granted in a different way from the norm of this genre) but this is not a book I would recommend.\u003cbr /\u003eFor sufferers, for family members of sufferers, or for well meaning people seeking to understand the hopelessness of some situations. I would recommend it for none.","rating":2,"shelving":{"__typename":"Shelving","shelf":{"__typename":"Shelf","name":"read","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/833538?shelf=read"},"taggings":[{"__typename":"Tagging","tag":{"__typename":"Tag","name":"ya-you-have-my-heart","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/833538?shelf=ya-you-have-my-heart"}},{"__typename":"Tagging","tag":{"__typename":"Tag","name":"2012","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/833538?shelf=2012"}},{"__typename":"Tagging","tag":{"__typename":"Tag","name":"books-that-made-me-cry","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/833538?shelf=books-that-made-me-cry"}},{"__typename":"Tagging","tag":{"__typename":"Tag","name":"2-stars","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/833538?shelf=2-stars"}}],"webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/226742301"},"likeCount":1061,"viewerHasLiked":null,"commentCount":227,"viewerCanComment({\"resourceType\":\"review\"})":null},"User:13742215":{"id":13742215,"__typename":"User","legacyId":13742215,"imageUrlSquare":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/users/1609348326i/13742215._UX200_CR0,33,200,200_.jpg","isAuthor":false,"textReviewsCount":239,"viewableName":"destini","isBlockedByViewer":false,"webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13742215-destini","contributor":null,"isFollowing":false,"isFriend":false,"followersCount":502},"Review:kca://review:goodreads/amzn1.gr.review:goodreads.v1.eB6_TH_2Ii6RZE_bKpj5rg":{"id":"kca://review:goodreads/amzn1.gr.review:goodreads.v1.eB6_TH_2Ii6RZE_bKpj5rg","__typename":"Review","book":{"__ref":"Book:kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.6rIwidkUTORGkQo3jY4dcg"},"creator":{"__ref":"User:13742215"},"recommendFor":"EVERYONE","updatedAt":1582239050680,"createdAt":1373291738000,"spoilerStatus":false,"lastRevisionAt":1455372473000,"text":"\u003cimg src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1380765347ra/3121276.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\"\u003e \u003cimg src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1380765347ra/3121277.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\n  \u003cem\u003e\n    \u003cstrong\u003eThe fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars \u003cbr\u003eBut in ourselves.\u003c/strong\u003e\n  \u003c/em\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1380765348i/3121278.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eThis is the first time I’ve truly been at a loss for words.

I really didn't. John Green has done an amazing job of making these characters feel so real to me. When they cried, I cried (bawled). When they laughed, I laughed. When they melted, I melted. Their romance was so epic and I know, I KNOW, that this is a book I will read over and over again and cry every single time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e The characters were perfection! Especially Augustus Waters. Not only is his name Augustus (which is epic in itself) He had the guts to go up to Hazel and just straight up ask her to come hang out with him. Nice guys finish last? I think not.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e You know this book was so awesmazing that I gave it its own tag. Just look up there and you'll see a little tag that says \"the-fault-in-our-stars\". It was THAT amazing. Seriously. So amazing that I'm pretty sure it was my first heartbreak... from a book. I really haven't felt that much from a book, much less a person, in a very long time.
